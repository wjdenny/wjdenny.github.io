The PDF has appendices for useful handouts and forms.

> [!summary] Summary
> Lam describes a process for training students to be effective peer reviewers.

## Notes
> despite these advantages, the current literature in support of the usefulness of peer review activities is inevitably undermined by some empirical evidence indicating a low ratio of incorporation of peer feedback into students' subsequent revisions ([[2006 Miao, Badger, & Zhen|Miao, Badger, & Zhen, 2006]]; [[2006 Min|Min, 2006]]; [[1999 Paulus|Paulus, 1999]]; [[2000 Tsui & Ng|Tsui & Ng, 2000]]). (page 114)

> **some ESL/EFL students believe that peer feedback-- as opposed to teacher feedback or self-generated feedback-- may be neither reliable nor professional enough to use** ([[2005 Hu|Hu]]; [[Leki (1990a)|Leki, 1990]]; [[2006 Min|Min]]; [[1998 Sengupta|Sengupta, 1998]]; [[2000 Tsui & Ng|Tsui & Ng]]). (page 114)

[[Studies show that English language learners place a low value on peer feedback]]

> studies centering on the effect of trained peer review on students' revision and writing quality have been burgeoning ([[1990 Berg|Berg, 1990]]; [[2009 Lundstrom & Baker|Lundstrom & Baker, 2009]]; [[2005 Min|Min, 2005]], [[2006 Min|2006]]; [[1999 Paulus|Paulus, 1999]]; [[2005 Rollinson|Rollinson]]). (page 115)

> whether these quality-enhancing revisions were due to the trained peer review itself or to students' self-revision during the writing process is not fully understood ([[2006 Min|Min]]; [[2008 Suzuki|Suzuki, 2008]]). (page 115)

> [[1990 Berg|Berg's study]], which compared the effect of one trained and another untrained peer review group on ESL students' revision types and quality, Min investigated the extent to which trained peer review feedback was actually incorporated into students' revisions and whether the number of peer-influenced revisions would be higher than that before peer review training. (page 115)

> [[2005 Min|Min]] concluded that **planned and trained peer review could directly have an effect on EFL students' revision types and overall quality of texts.** (page 115)

[[Peer review activity requires careful training in order to be useful to students]]

> I illustrate how **I planned and organized a training workshop for a group of 30 university freshmen non-English majors to help them analyze the effectiveness of peer feedback** according to its area (i.e., local or global), nature (i.e., revision-oriented or non-revision-oriented), and type (i.e., evaluation, clarification, suggestion, or alliteration). (page 115)

> **area is divided into global and local. Global areas refer to feedback about the content, idea development, purpose, and organization of writing, and local areas refer to feedback about mechanics, grammar, and punctuation.** (page 115)

[[The global area of writing is related to the higher-order features of content and organization]]
[[The local area of writing feedback is related to sentence-level grammar, spelling, and mechanics]]

> nature, namely, revision-oriented or non-revision oriented, and

> type. There are four types of peer feedback. *Evaluation* refers to judgements made by the peer reviewer on his or her partner's writing, but it provides no hints for further improvement. *Clarification* elicits explanations of those ideas that the peer reviewer does not understand and is usually in the form of interrogative statements. *Suggestion* means that the peer reviewer provides useful feedback to help the writer to make appropriate corrections, and *alteration* refers to errors that are directly or explicitly corrected by the peer reviewer; this type of peer comment is by far the most common in students' peer marking ([[2003 Liu & Sadler|Liu & Sadler, 2003]]). (page 115)

> conducting a focus group interview with six students whose English proficiency ranged from slightly above average to slightly below average. (page 116)

> I was disappointed to observe that fewer than half the peer comments were adopted in the form of actual revisions. (page 116)

> None of these 30 participants had experienced peer review activities prior to this workshop. (page 116)

> First, I introduced and defined peer review. I then explained to students the purpose of adopting peer review activities in this writing course. (page 117)

> according to [[Min (2006)]], explaining the nature of errors and providing feasible suggestions were the crucial steps in helping writers to make further modifications of their drafts, because without a sound justification, writers may be unconvinced of the need to adopt peer comments in their revisions. (page 117)

> I then shifted their focus to error corrections. (page 117)

> [[@1999ferris_response|Ferris's (1999)]] notion of treatable and non-treatable errors. (page 117)

> According to [[@1999ferris_response|Ferris]], treatable errors tend to be more rule-governed so that peer reviewers may find it easier to explain the nature of these errors; moreover, she discusses examples of treatable errors, which mainly consist of verb-related categories such as tense, form, passives, modal use, and so forth. ... errors related to prepositions, sentence patterns, and unidiomatic phrases are labeled non-treatable because they are difficult for peer reviewers to explain or address by suggesting correction tips unless the correct answers are provided directly to the writers. (page 117--118)

[[Treatable errors are rule-governed and thus easier to explain]]
[[Non-treatable errors are called this because they are difficult to explain and require tacit knowlege of the language]]

> If feedback generated by peer reviewers is mainly of a non-treatable nature, its effectiveness will be reduced, so that reviewers are strongly recommended in the peer review sessions to identify and explain treatable errors first. (page 118)

[[Correcting non-treatable errors are less effective in helping students avoid errors in the future]]

> Attention to content and language errors based on the assigned scoring rubrics was also prioritized. (page 118)

> I instructed peer reviewers to start examining coherence and argumentation in their  partners' work before diligently editing any linguistic errors. (page 118)

> students were invited to practice the four-step procedure with some authentic exemplars collected (page 118)

> Similarly, as writers they were also coached to analyze the extent to which they had responded to the peer feedback they themselves had received and to evaluate whether the suggestions offered by peer reviewers were incorporated into their own revisions (Appendix C). This final stage emphasized raising students' consciousness; it aimed to help them to engage more autonomously in peer review activities despite the much needed teacher intervention at the outset of the training process. (page 119)

> When they played the role of writers, they were taught how to keep track of the kinds of peer comments they received, analyze how much peer feedback they had incorporated in their first revision, and investigate why certain peer feedback could not be incorporated. (page 119--120)

> I arranged conferences with each pair of students to monitor whether they could manage to keep their peer review logs properly. (page 120)

> Unlike in [[2006 Min|Min's (2006)]] teacher-reviewer conferences, I expected students to raise questions about their uncertainties when categorizing peer feedback and their concerns about how to respond to it. I gave assistance to students in analyzing peer feedback and taught them how to make better revisions based on peer comments, but my approach was more student-fronted and avoided falling into the teaching trap of dominating the discourse of the conference as if I were reteaching parts of the course content ([[2004 Brown & Abeywickrama|Brown, 2004]]) (page 120)

> I conducted a 30-minute post-workshop interview with four students whose academic abilities ranged from above average to slightly below average. (page 120)

[[A time-efficient strategy in obtaining qualitative feedback from students is to sample students slightly above and slightly below the average proficiency]]

> The interview data also indicated that students who themselves were critical about their peers' work would become even more critical of their own writing if they were able to internalize the editing and revising skills acquired in the peer review training workshop. (page 120)

> As revealed by [[Rollinson (2005)]], teacher intervention is also one of the contributing factors that make the implementation of peer review activities profitable in the classroom. However, based on my observations, it is necessary to strike a balance between teacher intervention and teacher support. The former notion refers to direct and top-down assistance given to students collectively, without considering the needs of individual students; the latter concept refers to more context-sensitive and personalized assistance offered to specific students when they participate in the peer review process. (page 121--122)

> teacher support if used appropriately in peer review training or activities could motivate students to think more critically and independently about the comments they wish to make to their partners, and the teacher's role might be reduced to giving professional suggestions and clearing up any uncertainties about particular certain linguistic problems. Hence the degree of teacher involvement in training for peer review deserves much more attention than might at first glance seem necessary in order to foster students' autonomy in the activity. (page 122)

> if writing teachers intend to make peer review successful and beneficial for their students, it is imperative to plan each procedure carefully and to provide proper training. (page 122)

> Vague and rubber-stamp comments can easily be avoided if scoring guides are adopted during the peer review session. Teachers may also consider **inviting students themselves to construct part of the scoring guides in order to help them internalize the assessment criteria**, which in turns can help them give more effective peer feedback to their classmates. (page 122)

[[Co-constructing the rubric with students helps them provide better feedback to their peers]]

> Students should be trained to be responsible for applying editing strategies in their own work before undertaking peer evaluation. If they are more accountable for editing their own language errors before participating in the peer review activity, peer reviewers can attend specifically to any content errors in their partners' writing and may generate more constructive feedback for effective revisions. (page 123)

> Having students assume more responsibility for editing their own work before peer review would also reduce the workload of the peer reviewers, as well as making the event more efficient and successful. (page 123)

[[Requiring students to edit their own work before beginning peer review activities reduces the workload of peer reviewers]]
