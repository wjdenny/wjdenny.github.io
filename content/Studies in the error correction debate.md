I want to compare them on:
- condition groups present
- number of observations
- condition blindness
- inter-rater reliability issues
- L1 or L2
- target language
- time between pre- and post- assessment
- starting proficiency of the students
- did they conclude for or against error correction?
- oral or writing?
- did it measure their impromptu writing/speaking ability?

Then go back to [[@1996truscott_case|@truscott1996]] and build statements summarizing his evaluation of each study and my own critique.
