# Plurilingualism For U.S. Writing Classrooms

> [!summary] Summary
> Losey and Shuck argue for an asset-based mindset and inclusive attitude towards non-English languages in higher education.

## Notes
> We believe, therefore, that a shift in the perspective in the teaching of writing is needed-- one toward recognizing and **capitalizing on the many proficiencies students bring with them to the classroom (==an asset orientation==)**. (page 2)

> ... **fostering self-efficacy and self-confidence in learners** (page 2)

> ... allowing students access to all of their language resources gives them more opportunity to **build on their strengths**, exert **rhetorical agency with confidence**, and develop their writing abiltiies. (page 2)

[[Students can build on their strengths and develop agency along with their writing abilities when they are given the freedom to use all of their language resources]]

> Instructors who do invite students' full linguistic repertoires into the classroom are often delighted to **discover the range of their students' abilities and to learn the depth with which ==students can discuss their communicative choices when given the opportunity**== to do so. (page 2)

[[Students can explain their language choices more easily when allowed to do so in their preferred language]]

> the work of [[2009 Fu|Fu (2009)]], [[2013 Stille & Cummins|Stille & Cummins (2013)]], and others has shown, **bringing the students' first languages into second-language classrooms can offer significant support for second-language development.** (page 2)

> ... offering an option for students to translate an academic article or story then exploring the process and outcomes [[2016 Kiernan, Meier, & Wang|Kiernan, Meier, & Wang (2016)]]; and examining sentence-level choices with students, which creates possibilities for a new understanding of "error" [[2013 Stanley|(Stanley, 2013)]]. (page 2)

> ***code-meshing*--that is, the weaving together of multiple languages and varieties into a single text or spoken interaction.** [[Canagarajah (2013a)|(Canagarajah, 2013)]]. (page 3)

> The term *plurilingual* has been used by the Council of Europe as the basis for the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (page 3)

> it allows for all **students to see themselves as able to draw on the whole set of their communicative resources** to interact with each other and the world. (page 3)

> the ==**lingusitic repertoire does not have to be homogenous and therefore can encompass different degrees of proficiency**== in the different languages (page 4)

[[One's linguistic repertoire includes all languages that they have acquired, regardless of the level of proficiency]]

> speakers use a repertoire of communicative resources for different functions and can use different varieties at the same time in code-switching (page 4)

> **plurilingualism is a transversal competence and the ==teaching of different languages should be linked to one another**== (page 4)

**transversal** intersecting a system of lines; syn. *intersectional*

> **plurilingualism also involves a cultural aspect and the ==development of pluricultural compentence**== (page 4)

> multilingualism as a complex system that requires individuals to move not only among possible options available to them within their own individual repertoires in particular contexts (for example, wondering "Do I use Spanish or English with this person?") but also between alternatives that signal particular identities (such as whether to use Anglicized vs. Spanish pronunciations of Spanish names). (page 4)

> **Language knowledge ... not divided into discrete codes but is ==a single communicative repertoire**== that all individuals have at the ready, given the rhetorical need and communicative situation. (page 4)

[[All of a person's linguistic ability is combined into a single linguistic repertoire]]

> *plurilingual disposition*-- "an orientation of openness to lingustic difference as a resource to be dawn upon in communication" [[@2021shuck_stealth|(Shuck, this volume, p. 142)]]-- is adapted from [[Horner, et al. (2011)|Horner, Lu, Royster & Trimbur's (2011)]] notion of translingual dispotions. (page 6)

> **plurilingual pedagogies offer new ways to ==teach composition as a rhetorical act, rather than as simply a set of "rules for writing."==** These strategies empower students to analyze their audiences and purposes in order to make communicative choices from their entire linguistic repertoire. (page 6)

[[Plurilingual pedagogy goes beyond following writing rules and focuses on acts of communication that involves a student's entire linguistic repertoire]]

but what if the goal of the course is rules for writing, and rhetoric is several steps beyond?

> **To account for students' labor, several authors describe using ==[contract grading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_grading) as an approach that is linguistically inclusive.**== (page 6)
