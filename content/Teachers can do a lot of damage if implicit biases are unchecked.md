Teachers can do a lot of damage if implicit biases are unchecked. Even when we feel like we are calling on students equally, studies show there is often a preference because [[Implicit bias is a preference that is not under our conscious control]]. Biases can cause significant harm to students. These preferences can lower students' self-efficacy and affects students in both the preferred and non-preferred groups.
