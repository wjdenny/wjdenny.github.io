# Cedar Rapids listed as top destination for immigrants' second move

[[Linh Ta]] wrote this article for [[Axios Des Moines]].

> [!summary] Summary
> [[Cedar Rapids]] population of immigrants increased 66% between 2010 and 2020. [[There is a trend for immigrants to move to smaller cities with more affordable housing and tax policies]]

## Notes
> immigrants in the U.S. have increasingly chosen to live in smaller cities and more suburban areas â€” spreading demographic and social change across the country

> during their secondary moves, they are going to cities with more affordable housing and "growth-friendly" tax policies, according to the report.

> In 2018, Cedar Rapids created a "[Welcoming Cedar Rapids](https://www.cedar-rapids.org/discover%5Fcedar%5Frapids/welcome%5Fis%5Four%5Flanguage/index.php)" action plan focused on attracting international workers and providing funding support for their education and entrepreneurial goals.

I wonder what Iowa City does to attract international workers.
