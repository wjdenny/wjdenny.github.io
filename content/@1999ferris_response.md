## Notes
> my careful scrutiny of Truscott's evidence convinced me that his argument does *not* hold up at some key points and that his conclusions that "grammar correction has no place in writing courses and should be abandoned" ([[@1996truscott_case|1996]], [[1996 Truscott.pdf#page=2|p. 328]]) is premature and overly strong. [[1999 Ferris.pdf#page=2|page 2]]

> [[John Truscott|Truscott]] defines "grammar correction" only in the vaguest of terms: "correction of grammatical errors for the purpose of improving a student's ability to write accurately." He goes on to say that "correction comes in many different forms, but for present purposes such distinctions have little significance" ([[1996 Truscott.pdf#page=3|p. 329]]). This is where I, and most teachers I know, would disagree vehemently. As with any other aspect of teaching, there are more and less effective ways to approach error correction in L2 writing. We would all doubtless agree that poorly done error correction will not help student writers and may even mislead them. However, **there is mounting research evidence that effective error correction-- that which is selective, prioritized, and clear-- can and does help at least some student writers (for reviews and specific suggestions, see [[1993 Bates, Lane, & Lange|Bates, Lane, & Lange, 1993]]; [[1998 Ellis|Ellis, 1998]]; [[1995 Ferris|Ferris, 1995c]]; [[1998 Ferris & Hedgcock|Ferris & Hedgcock, 1998]]; [[1997 Reid|Reid, 1997]]).** This, in discussing whether or not grammar correction is "effective," it is crucially important to know what sort of error correction we are discussing. [[1999 Ferris.pdf#page=3|page 3--4]] 

> More often than not, the reviewer has under- or over-stated the findings and claims of the original studies to suit his or her own generalizations or arguments (see also [[1998 Spack|Spack, 1998]], for a discussion of the importance of reading primary sources). [[1999 Ferris.pdf#page=4|page 4]]

> The L2 error correction studies cited by Truscott examined very diverse groups of subjects. The vase majority of the studies ([[1981 Cardelle & Corno|Cardelle & Corno, 1981]]; [[1991 Kepner|Kepner, 1991]]; [[1982 Lalande|Lalande, 1982]]; [[1984 Semke|Semke, 1984]]) looked at subjects who were college-level foreign language students in the U.S. or who were EFL learners ([[1986 Robb, Ross, & Shortreed|Robb, Ross, & Shortreed, 1986]]; [[1992 Sheppard|Sheppard, 1992]]). It has been argued (e.g., [[1994 Hedgcock & Lefkowitz|Hedgcock & Lefkowitz, 1994]]) that foreign-language students are less motivated to revise and correct their work since their language classes do not focus extensively on multiple-draft process-oriented instruction and since their need to write fluently and accurately in the target language is typically limited to assignments within the language classroom. Only one of the studies reviewed in this section is a large-scale examination of ESL college students in the U.S. ([[1990 Fathman & Whalley|Fathman & Whalley, 1990]]). Acknowledging these crucial contextual differences, Truscott himself notes that "the students' origins and L1s varied widely" ([[1996 Truscott.pdf#page=8|p. 334]]). [[1999 Ferris.pdf#page=4|page 4]]

> [[John Truscott|Truscott]] points out that "There is some reason to think that syntactic, morphological, and lexical knowledge are acquired in different manners. If this is the case, then probably no single form of correction can be effective for al three" ([[1996 Truscott.pdf#page=17|p. 343]]). From my own experiences as a teacher of L2 writing, I have become increasingly convinced of the truth of this statement. I have previously suggested ([[1995a Ferris|Ferris, 1995a]], [[1995c Ferris|1995c]], [[1997 Ferris|1997]]; [[1998 Ferris & Hedgcock|Ferris & Hedgcock, 1998]]) that **students can be successfully taught to self-edit their own texts if they are (a) focused on the importance of editing; (b) trained to identify and correct patterns of frequent and serious errors; and (c) given explicit teaching as needed about the rules governing these patterns of errors. I have also argued that indirect error correction (identification of errors) is preferable to direct correction (teacher correction of student errors).** [[1999 Ferris.pdf#page=5|page 5]]

> Most systems advocated in writing textbooks and editing handbooks seem based on the assumption that "one size fits all" and that marking "wc" (for word choice) is the same as marking "vt" (for verb tense)-- ignoring the important fact that for the latter type of error, there are rules to consult, while the former type of error has none. ESL writing teachers would do well to give much more thought to how they provide error feedback regarding these different types of language forms and structures. [[1999 Ferris.pdf#page=6|page 6]]

[[Ferris suggests that different types of errors can be learned from differently]]

> ESL teachers need a thorough grounding in linguistic/syntactic theory and in how to teach grammar to L2 learners. In addition, teachers need ample opportunities for practice--with error analyses of student texts and in providing feedback, grammatical information, and strategy training for their students. [[1999 Ferris.pdf#page=6|page 6]]

> It is vitally important for teachers to commit themselves to selective error feedback and to a strategy for building students' awareness and knowledge of their most serious and frequent grammar problems. Careful prioritization increases teachers' chances of being accurate and thorough in their feedback (because they are focusing on only a few problems at a time), as well as preventing the inevitable teacher burnout and overload that results from trying to deal with every single problem in every student paper. [[Resources/Articles/1999 Ferris.pdf#page=7|page 7]]

> The thoughtful writing instructor will also address the issue of student motivation by raising student awareness about the importance of accuracy in their written texts and about the need to develop independent self-editing skills ([[1993 Bates, Lane, & Lange|Bates, Lane, & Lange, 1993]]; [[1995c Ferris|Ferris, 1995c]]; [[1997 Reid|Reid, 1997]]) [[Resources/Articles/1999 Ferris.pdf#page=7|page 7]]

> there is tremendous variability in students' ability to benefit from grammar instruction and feedback and to learn to self-correct and many students have made dramatic improvements in their accuracy over the course of a semester (see [[1995a Ferris|Ferris, 1995a]]). [[Resources/Articles/1999 Ferris.pdf#page=7|page 7]]

Anecdotes don't address the studies in the original argument, though.

> there are at least three important reasons to continue the practice until such time as it has been conclusively proven to be ineffective and/or harmful. [[Resources/Articles/1999 Ferris.pdf#page=8|page 8]]

> the importance that L2 students place on receiving grammar correction ... Truscott argues ... "does not mean teachers should give it to them" ([[@1996truscott_case|1996]], [[1996 Truscott.pdf#page=33|p. 359]]) many teachers would respond that the absence of any form of grammar feedback could frustrate students to the point that it might interfere with their motivation and confidence in the writing class, particularly when grading rubrics and writing proficiency examination results tell them that their language errors could prevent them from achieving their educational and professional goals. 

I side with [[John Truscott]] on this point. It doesn't address the points he made in [[@1996truscott_case]], and her logic rests on the assumption of the statistically significant effectiveness of grammar correction.

> Second, studies of university subject-matter instructors suggest that at least some English-speaking university faculty are less tolerant of "typical" ESL errors than of "typical" native speaker errors, and that professors feel that students' linguistic errors are bothersome and affect their overall evaluation of student papers. This line of research certainly implies that ESL teachers should focus some attention on educating their subject-matter colleagues as to the duration and limitations of the second language acquisition process. [[Resources/Articles/1999 Ferris.pdf#page=8|page 8]]

Scholars countering [[Monolingual Ideology]] such as [[@1993benesch_esl]], [[@2017kynard_stank]], and others might not consider this a valid argument.

> it is critical that students become more self-sufficient in editing their own writing. Though it is arguable whether grammar feedback and instruction will be consistently effective for all L2 student writers, it seems clear that the absence of any feedback or strategy training will ensure that many students never take seriously the need to improve their editing skills and that they will not have the knowledge or strategies to edit even when they do perceive its importance. [[Resources/Articles/1999 Ferris.pdf#page=8|page 8]]

> (see [[1990 Silva|Silva, 1990]], on the "merry-go-round of approaches" to teaching L2 writing that have been hastily adopted and discarded.) [[Resources/Articles/1999 Ferris.pdf#page=9|page 9]]

> Careful readers of "error gravity" research will note that the results of such studies have ben conflicting and that instructors in some disciplines and some contexts react differently to written errors by non-native speakers. This is another area in which the research is certainly inconclusive and inadequate. [[Resources/Articles/1999 Ferris.pdf#page=10|page 10]]
