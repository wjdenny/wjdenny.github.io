## Notes

Chomsky says that chatGPT's only contribution to education is to make it easier to plagiarize. ^f3156a

The systems understand nothing about cognition or learning, and in fact the better they get, the worse they will be at this.

He uses an example of generating a periodic table that does not distinguish between possible elements and impossible elements.

He also says that where he taught at MIT, students would never have used it because they were interested in the topics. They would not use this method of avoiding learning.

His strategy would be to make the education program interesting enough that students wouldn't want to avoid it.

He criticizes the failure of education system for the demand of services like what chatGPT offers. ^e5f8cf

This rote-memorization style of education was ridiculed during the Enlightenment. More on that? "Teaching to the test" -- he considers the worst form of education

He's also doubtful of any sort of brain-computer interface in the near future because we know so little about the brain as it is.

Use the tools, but don't trust what you see.

"It's not about what we are going to cover but what you are going to discover." -- quote from Chomsky from a colleague. ^ad29a8

What's the link between teaching to the test and competency based education? If it's truly student-centered, then we should recognize that not all students learn the same things at the same rates.

Privatization of education is a way of avoiding desegregation in schools.

Mass public education was a major U.S. contribution to democracy.
Land-grant universities were a major innovation in higher education.

### Critical pedagogy
John Dewey similar to Paolo Freire

The Crisis of Democracy; book recommendation
they say universities are failing in their task of indoctrinating the young (this coming from the Left)
