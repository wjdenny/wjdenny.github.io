> [!summary] Summary
> This study measured oral proficiency of 60 university students majoring in either French, German, or Spanish using an oral proficiency interview, dictation tasks, and a self-appraisal of oral proficiency. Young also measured individual's state anxiety and cognitive interference during the task. 
## Notes
> Professionals in foreign language education, however, have serious concerns about the OPI test (Lantolf & Frawley, 1985; Savignon, 1985). 

These are sources for concerns about OPI test.

> Existing research on test anxiety shows that anxiety can affect an individual's performance both positively and negatively (Alpert & Haber, 1960; Benton, Hartman, & Sarason, 1955; Daly & Stafford 1984; McCroskey, 1984a; Pimsleur, Mosberg, & Morrison, 1962; Sarason, 1978, 1980a, 1980b, 1983; Schwarzer, van der Ploeg, & Spielberger, 1982; Spielberger, 1972; Spielberger, Gonzalez, Taylor, Algaze, & Anton, 1978; Verma & Nijhawan, 1976).

Performance on oral proficiency evaluations are affected by anxiety in both positive and negative ways.

> Some research on test anxiety indicates that an individual's objectively measured ability to perform the task at hand can determine the effect of anxiety on performance (Spielberger, 1966a; Verma & Nijhawan, 1976). 
> ...
> One study investigated the effects of anxiety, reinforcement, and intelligence on the learning of a difficult task and found that anxiety and reinforcement do not have any effect on performance when the individual has "adequate capacity to perform the task" (Spielberger, 1966, p. 306). With subjects of low ability, however, anxiety interferes with learning under all reinforcement conditions. [page 57]

The person's language proficiency is moderates the effect of anxiety on performance. 

Does that mean, it's not a linear relationship?  So, instead of $y = x + b_0*x + b_1*x + e$ with $b_0$ being proficiency and $b_1$ being anxiety; it's more like $y = x + b_0 * x + b_0 * b_1 * x + e$?

Maybe it would be helpful to be able to flag students as being apprehensive or anxious which should allow them to re-take the test after some time.

> Research in speech communication also suggests anxiety can affect an individual's performance. Anxiety, for example, may affect the quality of an individual's communication or willingness to communicate (Daly & Stafford, 1984; McCroskey, 1978, 1984a). McCroskey has labeled this anxiety over speaking as "communication apprehension".

Linguistic minority students should be eligible for reasonable accommodations.

> Researchers in second language learning or performance have recognized the potentially negative effect of anxiety on language learning-- witness the emergence of teaching methodologies such as the Natural Approach, Counseling-Learning and Suggestopedia. [page 58]

The Natural Approach is a pedagogical method designed to mitigate anxiety among language learners.

Counseling-Learning is a pedagogical method designed to mitigate anxiety among language learners.

Suggestopedia is a pedagogical method designed to mitigate anxiety among language learners.

> Although much research has been done on test anxiety and communication apprehension and some on anxiety and second language learning, there is little research available specifically on the relationship between anxiety and oral performance in a foreign language testing situation. The exceptions are Kleinmann (1977) and Steinberg (1982). [page 58]

Kleinmann looks like an interesting paper to read on this topic.
*Avoidance behavior in adult second language acquisition.*

> Steinberg (1982) studied the role of anxiety on second language oral performance by inducing anxiety in half of her subjects and comparing oral performance by groups-- the anxiety-induced group with that of the group with no induced anxiety. She found that her more anxious individuals tended to be less subjective and more objective in their oral responses than the less anxious individuals. [page 58]

Anxious speakers were found to be more objective and detached in their speech.

re: Spielberger 1966; what is reinforcement? How does "capacity" affect test anxiety?

> The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between anxiety and foreign language oral performance, but to determine this relationship accurately, language ability had to be taken into account. This was done through two independent instruments, a Self-Appraisal of Speaking Proficiency and a dictation test. To insure an accurate assessment of anxiety, four separate anxiety instruments were employed. [page 59]

> The Oral Proficiency Interview is derived from the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) Oral Interview test and is designed to assess oral performance in a foreign language on the basis of a face-to-face structured conversations. Since the FSI test was developed out of the need to assess the language skills of foreign service officers, changes were made by the Educational Testing Service, the Interagency language Roundtable, and ACTFL to adapt it to meet the "needs and purposes of the academic community" (Omaggio, 1986, p. 12).

The Oral Proficiency Interview was derived from the Foreign Service Institute's Oral Interview test. 
See Omaggio 1986, *Teaching Language in Context*

> A dictation test was used to assess subject's global language proficiency. Research indicates that there is a high correlation between dictation test results and language proficiency (Becheller, 1980; Croft, 1980; Cziko, 1980; Oller & Streiff, 1975; Savignon, 1982; Stansfield, 1985). 

There is a high correlation between dictation tasks and language proficiency.
*Dictation as a measure of communicative competence in French as a second language* Savignon 1982

> The dictation paragraphs were written at three different levels: intermediate, advanced, and superior. In composing these paragraphs, ACTFL provisional profieincy guielines for listening, speaking, and writing were kept in mind. For each language, at least two paragraphs per level were sent off to two ACTFL-trained OPI interview/raters; each rater assigned an independent ACTFL rating to each paragraph. Only paraphrases which were rated similarly by both ACTFL raters were used in the dictation; for example, when two raters assigned a rating of intermediate to the same paragraph, that paragraph was selected as the intermediate-level dictation paragraph. [page 59--60]

> The State Anxiety Inventory assessed subjects' level of anxiety prior to taking the OPI. Spielberger (1983) distinguishes between "state anxiety" and "trait anxiety." Whereas state anxiety reflects an "unpleasant emotional state or condition," trait anxiety is regarded as a "relatively stable individual difference in anxiety-proneness as a personality trait" (1983, p. 1).

State anxiety is a reaction to a specific stimulus. Trait anxiety is an inherent and stable part of the personality. 

> The Cognitive Interference Questionnaire attempted to sample subjects' thoughts during the OPI and dictation tests. A cognitive interpretation of test anxiety maintains that the discrepancy in performance between high test-anxious and low test-anxious individuals arises from the "differential attention focuses of high and low test-anxious persons in evaluative conditions, with the test anxious individual dividing attention between self-preoccupied worry and task cues and the less anxious person focusing more fully on the task-relevant variables (Wine, 1980, p. 355)."

High and low anxiety individuals are subject to differing levels of interference during OPIs.

> The Foreign Language Anxiety Scale of Reactions approached anxiety indirectly by probing subjects' general attitudes toward speaking in a foreign language. This scale consists of several sample items taken from Horwitz's Scale of Reactions to Foreign Language Class in addition to several items specifically constructed for this study. [page 60]

> In practical terms this indicates that ability, not anxiety, is the more important variable affecting OPI scores, at least unde the conditions of an unofficial administration of the OPI. The subjects of this study were not terribly anxious, perhaps because they knew that the OPI results could have no negative repercussions for them. Thus, under these conditions the OPI test may indeed have been solely a measure of the subjects' language proficiency. [page 63]

This study would be almost useless, then, if it wasn't a true OPI given under similar conditions as a placement test.

> Results indicated that anxiety did not exert as much influence as ability on foreign language oral proficiency scores in an unofficial administration of the OPI. 

Anxiety had no significant affect on performance of a practice OPI.

If another study did the same conditions using a real OPI with consequences, the two combined could be powerful evidence.
