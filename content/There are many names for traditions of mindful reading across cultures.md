There are many names for traditions of mindful reading across cultures. Guigo II's Lectio divina is similar to the kabbalistic PaRDeS steps of surface (peshat), hidden/symbolic (remez), comparative (derash), and esoteric/mystical (sod). The differences between those two and ter Kuile's formulation seem to be in that last step. Guigo doesn't get into much detail about how to approach each of those (at least in modern terms, meditating, praying, and contemplating all mean roughly the same thing), and ter Kuile's last step takes a more secular and practical approach.
