## Rationale
_Imposter phenomenon is increasingly common among students and causes stress, anxiety, isolation, and negative mental and physical health outcomes_ [_(Doggett, 2019)_](https://acue.instructure.com/courses/2565/pages/itel3-references)_. Stereotype threat, which describes the experience of students afraid to confirm a negative stereotype about their identity, leads students to experience high stress and lowered performance_ [_(Steele & Aronson, 1995)_](https://acue.instructure.com/courses/2565/pages/itel3-references)_. Reducing the impact of imposter phenomenon and stereotype threat by fostering a sense of belonging in your students can go a long way in motivating students, calming their anxieties, and ultimately increasing the likelihood that they will be successful._ ^4b584a

## Introduction

**Jonathan Cisco, PhD; Associate Director, Teaching for Learning; Assistant Teaching Professor, Learning, Teaching & Curriculum; University of Missouri [00:00:14]** 
Imposter phenomenon refers to this overwhelming feeling that you are an intellectual fraud. 

**Sarah, Student; The University of Texas at Arlington [00:00:20]** 
Sometimes it's easy to compare myself and with my peers and say, well, I didn't do that, or I don't have this award, or I didn't get this this funding. So what am I even doing here? 

**Thomas Freeman, PhD; STEM Lecturer; Department of Chemistry; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [00:00:36]** 
So, stereotype threat is when you are afraid that you're going to conform to a negative stereotype about your social group, and in doing so, that creates an anxiety where you end up failing and conforming to what you actually believe is true. It's almost like a self-fulfilling prophecy type of thing.  ^47b5c1

**Stephanie, Student; Kansas State University [00:00:55]** 
He talked a lot about the stereotype threat of women not believing that they are as good with math, or numbers, or any of those typical male dominant careers or professions. It's just kind of fascinating how our assumptions actually really in so many ways define our lives as students and beyond. 

[[Stereotype threat is an internalized bias where the person believes a stereotype about their identity to be true]]

**Jandel Crutchfield, PhD, LCSW; Assistant Professor; School of Social Work; The University of Texas at Arlington [00:01:17]**
If you feel like you don't belong, then you don't bring all of your tools, right? Your struggle in class is not the solution to the question the professor is posing. Your struggle is, do I even deserve to answer the question? So there are very different struggles. And so when you feel like you belong, then what you're grappling with is actually the material, actually the curriculum, actually the content. And so when we are teaching our students to solve these worldwide problems, we want them to be struggling with the problem itself and not thinking that they're the problem or that they don't belong. And so it's crucial that they feel like they belong because that brings everybody to the table to be actually be able to focus on the work. 

**Liz, Student; California State University, East Bay [00:02:02]** 
It matters to me that a professor says, you know, you belong here. You are good at this. You just need to have confidence in yourself.

[[Stereotype threat reduces the efficacy of students because they believe the stereotype to be true even when it is not]]
## Reducing the Impact of Imposter Phenomenon  
###### Student [00:00:05]
When I got accepted into my honors program at college and an additional Walter Williams scholarship group, I did not believe that I should have been there. I thought that I was either the very last spot on that call or on that, in that scholarship, or that I just got the pity vote, or that everybody got it. 

###### Student [00:00:22]
I often tell myself, you're really not a good writer. How are you in grad school? You're not even a good writer. You can't write. 

###### Student [00:00:28]
Sometimes it's easy to compare myself and with my peers and say, well, I didn't do that or I don't have this award or I didn't get this this funding. So, what am I even doing here? 

###### Jonathan Cisco, PhD; Associate Director, Teaching for Learning; Assistant Teaching Professor, Learning, Teaching & Curriculum; University of Missouri [00:00:48]
==Imposter phenomenon refers to this overwhelming feeling that you are an intellectual fraud. ==

###### Jandel Crutchfield, PhD, LCSW; Assistant Professor; School of Social Work; The University of Texas at Arlington [00:00:54]
Imposter syndrome, I think is really about the lack of a sense of belonging in whatever space you show up in, and for students, that oftentimes means class. 

###### Jonathan Cisco, PhD [00:01:03]
Some of the characteristics of imposter phenomenon relate to things like wanting to be the very, very best at what you do. In other words, setting extreme standards. So, some scholars have called this superhuman aspects of imposter phenomenon. Setting extreme standards for yourself that inevitably you will fail that, of course, because they're extreme standards. Another characteristic of imposter phenomenon is that it can manifest in what looks like procrastinating behavior when what's happening is that because this piece of work hasn't reached the extreme standard of the person suffering from those feelings, they don't turn it in. 

###### John Paul Horn, PhD, MSW; Assistant Professor; Department of Social Work; California State University, East Bay [00:01:46]
One of the things that I've noticed about imposter syndrome with my students is that students will often not ask for the type of support that they need because they think that other students who belong in that environment wouldn't need that support. 

###### Jandel Crutchfield, PhD, LCSW [00:02:01]
There's always a preface when a student is experiencing imposter syndrome, a preface that indicates that they feel like they don't belong. So, you know, well, **my English is not very good, so forgive me for what I might be saying that doesn't sound correct.** Instead of just giving the answer, right? Well, you know, I don't have lots of people in my family that have gotten a doctorate, but I'm here because I want to, right? And so all of the other stuff, I tell them, it's interesting to know about your family background, but you are here. You belong here. 

###### Jonathan Cisco, PhD [00:02:40]
The consequences of imposter phenomenon can be really severe. So, **we know that it can trigger illness and all sorts of traumas. We know that it can manifest in insomnia and depression and anxiety.** We know people that feel like impostors tend to never enjoy their inevitable success. Remember that people that feel like impostors are typically the most highly capable or the highly successful, and so they will inevitably succeed. But what is success to someone that is an imposter phenomenon victim? It's yet another opportunity to be found out from what they truly are. And so that to me is the greatest tragedy when it comes to imposter phenomenon is folks that are otherwise highly successful, doing wonderful things, do not enjoy their own success.

###### Jandel Crutchfield, PhD, LCSW [00:03:35]
We want them to remember the content of the curriculum. We don't want them to remember the feeling of not belonging. And so, again, it, it all goes back to our students being able to learn the content that we teach. **Imposter syndrome inhibits that. And so we have to address it.** 

###### John Paul Horn, PhD, MSW [00:03:56]
One of the ways that I help students understand imposter syndrome is that I talk about my experiences as an instructor and my experiences having imposter syndrome, not just as a student, but as a faculty member and as a researcher, because I think it's important that students recognize that **imposter syndrome is normal for folks to have.** 

###### Nicole Blalock, PhD; Assistant Professor, American Indian Studies Program; Core Faculty, Educational Leadership & Policy Studies Doctoral Program; California State University, Northridge [00:04:17]
At the beginning of all of my courses. I also share with students video about myself. I put together a little slideshow of pictures and talked to them about my own background, where I come from and how I got to where I am. **As a first-generation college student. I myself did struggle with imposter syndrome** and not being sure really how do engage with the community of a university beyond a classroom. 

###### Jonathan Cisco, PhD [00:04:49]
**Professors need to be willing to share those feelings**, first and foremost, whether it's a journal entry or just talking about the various times in their lives when they felt this way, because **it provides a very safe and welcoming environment of resilience, because the students start to see, oh, here is this professor, this disciplinary expert. And they felt the same way that I feel.** 

###### Jonathan Cisco, PhD [00:05:21]
I was accepted into a rather prestigious graduate program. And the first week was OK. The second week I really started to freak out. There was this journal article of all things that I was assigned and I was having trouble reading. I was starting to spiral in this journal entry feeling like I was getting shaky because, you know, here it was, as in graduate school, this is what I wanted, blah, blah, blah. But I started to feel incredibly defeated. I dropped out. I dropped out after that journal entry and I thought I will never approach academia again. So, it was that imposter phenomenon that really led me to kind of quite a dark place for a long time before many years later when I went back to graduate school. 

###### Mason, Student [00:06:11]
When you see a professor and someone who is very, very well versed in his field talking about how he struggled in his field, it it makes it easier for us to open up and sort of share our experiences in our field. 

###### Jonathan Cisco, PhD [00:06:27]
And then the other element is to group people that feel the same way together, introducing the student voice as much as possible, as much as reasonable for that course, context is really important. 

###### Kiana, Student [00:06:38]
I was principal clarinetist at my school for a couple of years, but every time I achieved something in that, I either couldn't believe it or couldn't get excited about it or just, I don't know, I would go out of every single audition I ever did feeling absolutely terrible about it, and then be unable to understand why I actually achieved something, because I never felt like I put enough work in or that I was good enough to be that, you know, standard. 

###### Mason, Student [00:07:05]
I think that the impact of hearing sort of, some other examples from other students, other people like me who experience imposter phenomenon, it really makes us seem like we're not just in this alone. It really makes it look like we're all in this together. 

###### Jonathan Cisco, PhD [00:07:22]
When students have shared these feelings with me, or with the whole class, or both, I always follow up with them. And that can be as simple, and often is as simple, as a genuine small expression of care. I know it's finals week. How's that working for you? Is there anything I can do? These genuine expressions of care that take 20 seconds can make the world of difference for the students, all of them, in particular those that have been courageous enough to share their feelings with me in the class.

## Reducing the Impact of Stereotype Threat

##### Thomas Freeman, PhD; STEM Lecturer; Department of Chemistry; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  
[00:00:14] 
So, stereotype threat is when you are afraid that you're going to conform to a negative stereotype about your social group. And in doing so, that creates an anxiety where you end up failing and conforming to what you actually believe is true. It's almost like a self-fulfilling prophecy type of thing. 

##### Kristina Ruiz-Mesa, PhD; Associate Professor & Basic Course Director; Department of Communication Studies; California State University, Los Angeles [00:00:34] 
So, we have many social identity groups that we see ourselves as a part of, and we do not want to confirm negative stereotypes about any of our groups. And so our behaviors,  
our communication, how we interact will be impacted by the thoughts that we are having about how to avoid confirming stereotypes.  

##### Mike Wesch, PhD; Professor of Cultural Anthropology; University Distinguished Teaching Scholar; Department of Sociology, Anthropology, and Social Work; Kansas State University [00:00:53] 
Common ones are like women or minorities in math. And this idea that, you know, if you are a woman, you're not good at math. And that voice can come to somebody and say, like, you're not a math person. I mean, there are so many people who have that voice in their head, like, I'm not a math person. And the moment that voice comes in, suddenly it stifles your ability to actually think about the problem in front of you.  

##### Mike Wesch, PhD [00:01:16] 
This is a research project by Jay Stone out in Arizona, where in which he studied mini-golf. And very simple situation he set up, he set up a miniature golf course and then he would have students come in to play the mini-golf course. And on day one, he would say this mini-golf course is a specially designed to measure your raw, athletic ability. It has nothing to do with anything else. It's all about your raw, athletic ability. And black students would outperform white students. And then the next day he would have the same exact course. But he would introduce it by saying this course has nothing to do with your raw, athletic ability. It's all about your ability to see geometry and see angles and measure angles, and the white students outperform the black students. So again, it's like these messages are having these profound effects on how we perform. And it's not just the message of that day, it's the messages that we've been receiving our whole lives about who we are and what we can do.  

##### Stephanie, Student; Kansas State University [00:02:16] 
He talked a lot about the stereotype threat of women not believing that they're as good with math or numbers or any of those typical male dominant careers or professions. It's just kind of fascinating how our assumptions actually, really in so many ways define our lives as students and beyond.   ^88b097

##### Mike Wesch, PhD [00:02:32] 
I think the broader picture here is that students, the traditional age students, age 18 to 22, are at a point in their life where they're asking themselves really big questions like, who am I? And what am I going to do? Am I going to make it? And stereotype threat really represents all of these answers that society is giving them. Well, who are you? You're a woman. What are you going to do? Well, you're not going to do X, Y and Z because you're a woman. Am I going to make it? Maybe not because you're a woman. So, somehow we have to get them past these answers to the big questions they're, they're asking right now and see that they can create their own lives and their own answers.  

##### Kristina Ruiz-Mesa, PhD [00:03:25] 
How I address stereotype threat, how I address imposter syndrome, these kinds of concerns is very openly, and so I will be very open about experiences that I've had with stereotype threat or imposter syndrome and talk about the ways that I have addressed that.

##### Kristina Ruiz-Mesa, PhD [00:03:40] 
If you're struggling with something, that doesn't mean you're a bad student. It means that you might need a little extra time. You might need time with the teacher, you might need time with the material or with a tutor. It just means that for that class, you might have to work harder. You might have to put in more time and more effort.  

##### Kristina Ruiz-Mesa, PhD [00:03:56] 
So, another way to minimize stereotype threat in the classroom is, again, by bringing in diverse voices, perspectives, theories and things that might not necessarily be in the traditional canon within your field. So, recognizing opportunities and expansions of theories, of ideas and concepts that we can then incorporate into our classrooms, additionally, making sure that our language is inclusive, that we are not referring to gendered occupations, that we are making sure that the students can see themselves in their various identities, in their different intersectional experiences reflected in the readings, assessments, assignments and guest lectures in the course.  

##### Kristina Ruiz-Mesa, PhD [00:04:34] 
If I say I want you to picture a civil engineering student, are you going to picture Jenay? And if you are maybe, you know, Jenay, maybe you go to this campus. If you don't, who is the image, right? When I say, professor, what is the image that comes into your head? Who is the image? And it's because of social discourses. We are taught to think that certain occupations, certain identities look like certain people. And that's a problem.  

##### ##### Santiba D. Campbell, PhD; Associate Professor, Psychology; Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences; Bennett College [00:04:58] 
When I first started at Bennett College, I used to do this exercise in one of my general education classes where I had all the young ladies close their eyes and tell me what does a scientist look like? And of course, they will give me the crazy examples. He hasn't combed his hair. He has on a lab coat. He's holding a beaker. And I was just amazed, probably the first two or three times that this occurred, and by the fourth time, I thought I had to do something about this because how am I at a woman's institution, but yet the scientist image is always male and they give me this crazy old guy description? So, one of the things I decided to start doing in my class is bringing in those scientists, bringing in scientists that aren't just your typical scientists, not, you know, that chemists that they're familiar with, but getting them to understand that researchers are scientists, too. And what better way to do that than also bring in women to look like them to understand process?  

##### Zybrea, Student; Bennett College [00:05:58] 
One question that she exercises in class is when you think of a doctor or scientist, who do you think? What what do you see? And after my first year of college, my answer became, I think of me, but prior to that, my answer was an Einstein, or a white person, or specifically a white male in the medical field, because I didn't see or wasn't exposed to, let alone women being in the medical field, being in the psych field and also black women being in that field. So, all I knew was what I was taught and exposed to from high school. However, after getting exposure to not just what I was exposed to in high school, but also people who look like me, it made me change my response and it made me put myself in that ranking.  

##### Kelly A. Hogan, PhD; Associate Dean of Instructional Innovation, QEP Director; STEM Teaching Professor, Department of Biology; College of Arts & Sciences; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [00:06:56] 
One example I like to use with my students is a scientist named Rosalind Franklin, and she was instrumental in the discovery of the structure of DNA. But if you look at who won the Nobel Prize, it's a man named Maurice Wilkins and then Watson and Crick, who most people know those names, three men. But that work would have never come to fruition without the work of Rosalind Franklin.  

##### Kelly A. Hogan, PhD [00:07:21] 
I want to talk a little bit more about Rosalind Franklin, especially as a woman in science. I don't think we see enough images of these historical figures who are women and recognize the contributions that they made and why they're often not recognized for these contributions.  

##### Kelly A. Hogan, PhD [00:07:37] 
Ideas as simple as bringing in Rosalind Franklin or having students work on projects where they identify scientists that bring diverse perspectives, allow us to recognize we need more role models and everybody should find somebody that looks like them or has a perspective like them so that they don't have to walk into a course and say, can I be a scientist? Is that something I can actually do? It should just be a given. Look at all these people that are like me. Yeah, I can do this if I want to do this.  

##### Elizabeth, Student; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [00:08:07] Dr. Hogan taught us about Rosalind  
Franklin's contribution to the discovery of DNA structure, which I appreciated because a lot of people only know about Watson and Crick. So I like that conscious effort to kind of rewrite the history a little bit to show, to shine light on the women who helped in science. And it makes me feel like I am welcomed as a woman in science myself.

## Establish Peer-to-Peer Support
##### Student [00:00:05] 
It matters to me that a professor says, you know, you belong here, you are good at this. You just need to have confidence in yourself.  

##### Student [00:00:13] 
She makes you want to give more. And so that, for me, made me feel like I belonged in her class.  

##### Student [00:00:20] 
It did feel like we were all struggling together, you know? So I think that, it was like a sense of camaraderie.  

##### Student [00:00:27] 
I know these people. I've built friendships with them. I feel comfortable with them, comfortable enough to be vulnerable, comfortable enough to, you know, really express how I'm feeling.  

##### Student [00:00:36] 
You're all going through the same experiences. You're all going through the same challenges. So going through that with someone else definitely makes it a lot easier to avoid the feelings of imposter syndrome and increase the sense of belonging.  

##### Rudy Jean-Bart, MASS; Assistant Professor; Social Behavioral Sciences & Human Services; Broward College [00:01:00] 
Having students feel included and be a part of the community is essential to attempting to eradicate imposter syndrome, as well as their student success, and then feeling as though they belong. And if they can see that their peers are successful and thriving in the class or see that their peers may have some of those fears and anxieties, then definitely those who are excelling can be, serve as an inspiration to those who are struggling a little bit.  

##### Kevin Kelly, EdD; Lecturer, Department of Equity; Leadership Studies & Instructional Technologies; San Francisco State University [00:01:26] 
I establish peer-to-peer support in my class in a few different ways. I have them sign up for a virtual study buddies using an online Google form and then they can see the spreadsheet of the different people who have signed up and they can find people who have similar times that they might be able to connect and possibly different areas. I know over distance sometimes it might even be different time zones. Another way I have students establish peer-to-peer support, is I reach out to veteran online learners and ask them to support other online learners in the discussion forums.  

##### Brokk Toggerson, PhD; Lecturer; College of Natural Sciences, Department of Physics; The University of Massachusetts, Amherst [00:02:01] 
One of the important things in a large class is to have an asynchronous communication platform. And this is true whether the classes is remote or face-to-face. **You need some sort of asynchronous platform where students can ask each other questions and support each other. And lately I have been using Slack for this purpose.** I set up a few channels and the students are free to post questions on homework. Or when they're studying for exams, they can say, "Hey, I was working on this additional practice problem and I wasn't able to get it. Can someone help me out?"  

##### Santiba D. Campbell, PhD; Associate Professor, Psychology; Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences; Bennett College [00:02:40] 
One way to create a more inclusive environment and have students feel a certain sense of belonging is remind them that they're there to help each other. Oftentimes in class, I might introduce a new phenomenon. I'm getting blank faces back. But there's that one student who may nod their head. Or that one student is smiling. **One of the things I like to do is ask that student to explain it to everybody else. I just, you know, gave this, in my mind, great example and definition. But it doesn't land. Ask their peers to give it a shot.** And a lot of times that peer-to-peer support can not only make the class more engaging, but it's gonna provide better understanding because now they're explaining it to their peers as they would want someone to explain to them.

##### ##### Kevin Kelly, EdD [00:03:27] 
I was able to connect with other students immediately from this class and we would talk to each other and just ask each other questions and clarify things and we'd work on projects together. And whenever we had questions, either we'd just answer it for each other or we'd work together and send an email to Professor Kelly.  

##### Dale Ireland, MA; Lecturer; English Department; California State University, East Bay [00:04:12] 
I work with my students every week and we have writing groups. And in these writing groups we create a safeness in how we talk about our writing. And we bring writing that's half-baked, not the cake you'd necessarily want to pull out of the oven and eat, but something you might want to talk about in terms of how you might work on the recipe next time. And so in our writing groups, we come together and it's a safe place to say, "I don't know, I'm not sure about this. I don't know where to go with this." And they start to see themselves in one another. They start to see asking questions as a part of what we do in academia. It's a lot of what we do in academia, and it doesn't mean you don't belong.  

##### Daniel, Student; California State University, East Bay [00:05:00] 
Definitely the group work helps you feel more accountable. And I think that sense of accountability is what, you know, you want to be prepared not so much for the teacher, but for your partners. You don't want let them down.  

##### Brokk Toggerson, PhD [00:05:13] 
In the first-semester physics course we have exams, but they're **pyramid. So they they do it individually and then they do a very similar exam in their teams.** We also have quizzes at the beginning of each unit, which are also pyramid. So they do it individually and then as a team. Teams are great for a large class because they effectively cut the number of units you have to deal with by the team size. Particularly in a physics course for non-physics students, teams also serve a benefit for adding to a sense of community and inclusion because the students see that they're not the only ones struggling and they have support. And in, part of my teams is I mix up the majors, so, you know, there's a bio major and a chem major in together and they bring their different skills and backgrounds to help solve the problem. And I think it helps them see the benefits of teamwork in science, which is how all science is done nowadays anyway. So that's important.  

##### Deirdre, Student; The University of Massachusetts, Amherst [00:06:14] 
I found myself being more successful when I completed exams or compared answers to exams with the group because we were all able to talk through our thought process and talk through how we went about solving problems rather than just finding out the answers were.  

##### Rudy Jean-Bart, MASS [00:06:32] 
There's been times where students have kind of fallen out of the class and group members will reach out to the student and say, hey, hope everything's okay or, hey, you know, come back to the class. Or there are times where students will tell me, I reached out to so-and-so, this is what's going on with so- and-so. When you build a sense of community in the classroom, then everyone becomes aware that a student is missing. And I think that is the ticket when it comes to creating groups and creating an environment of the community. Is that when one of us is missing, then we feel it.

## Cultivating a Sense of Belonging: Invite Your Former Students to Share Their Struggles and Success Strategies  

##### Jandel Crutchfield, PhD, LCSW; Assistant Professor; School of Social Work; The University of Texas at Arlington [00:00:05] 
**If you feel like you don't belong, then you don't bring all of your tools, right? Your struggle in class is not the solution to the question the professor is posing.** Your struggle is, do I even deserve to answer the question, right? So, they're very different struggles. And so **when you feel like you belong, then what you're grappling with is actually the material, actually the curriculum, actually the content.** And so when we are teaching our students to solve these worldwide problems, we want them to be struggling with the problem itself and not thinking that they are the problem or that they don't belong. And so **it's crucial that they feel like they belong because that brings everybody to the table to be actually be able to focus on the work.**  

##### Jessica Weiss, PhD; Professor, Director of Faculty Development; Department of History; California State University, East Bay [00:00:59] 
**It can be a good idea to bring students who have successfully completed the course back into the classroom at the beginning of the course, the following semester, and one could think about assembling a panel of successful course takers who look like the current class, who resemble them demographically.** And you're bringing those students in as reassurance and affirmation to the students in the class that what may seem daunting is possible and that they see somebody like themselves very close to themselves in age, a near peer who's made it through.  

##### Thomas Freeman, PhD; STEM Lecturer; Department of Chemistry; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [00:01:43] 
So class we have a group of my former students who are going to tell you about some strategies that they employed to be successful in my class. I'll let them state their name and tell you one idea or one tactic that they use to be successful in the class.  

##### Thomas Freeman, PhD [00:01:58] 
We have a mentoring program where students who were in a class previously who seem to perform well, they get to serve as in-class mentors, where they go around and help us facilitate group work. And they have a special appreciation for the type of things that we do in class.  

##### Claudia, Student; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [00:02:17] 
Hi, everyone. I'm Claudia. I think one of the most important things is that Dr. Freeman allows a lot of opportunity for interaction among your fellow students and one of the best things to do is take that outside the classroom. And we kind of became a social support outside of class, so when you were struggling in the class, you kind of you had people you knew and that you were interacting with and who knew how you worked in class that you could go to.  

##### Thomas Freeman, PhD [00:02:39] 
It's really important for them to hear from their peers because you can say to them, blue in the face, oh, all the evidence points to this is the best way to do a class. You don't care about that, right? But when they see someone who, you know, looks like them, who's their age, from all different kinds of backgrounds saying, yeah, this worked for me, and here's some other tips that help you be successful. They're going to listen to that.  

##### Viji Sathy, PhD; Professor of the Practice, Psychology and Neuroscience; UNC College of Arts & Sciences; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [00:03:01] 
Now we're going to get to do something, what I think is very fun. You're going to actually review some of the feedback that students in the course from last semester or the advice that they offer you.

##### Viji Sathy, PhD [00:03:11] 
**Advice cards are something I like to do on the last day of class, or one of the last meetings that we have, where I ask students to reflect on not only what they might have learned or attitudes that they might have had changed over the course of the class period, but also to give advice to a future student. And I usually couch it as it's difficult for a student coming in to know what to expect.**  

##### Viji Sathy, PhD [00:03:34] 
Of the few that you've read, can anyone relay some of the key things that you heard in the advice?  

##### Student [00:03:40] 
So a lot of the cards that I saw, I said watch the videos. . .  

##### Viji Sathy, PhD [00:03:43] 
OK, watch the videos. How many of you had something or read something about watch the videos? Can you just get to see a show of hands? OK.  

##### Viji Sathy, PhD [00:03:50] 
I can tell them what to expect, but it means so much more when it comes from a peer, especially a peer who has just recently gone through the course.  

##### Shannon, Student; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [00:03:59] 
It's interesting when your peers give you feedback or advice as opposed to a superior. Again, superiors are going to say the same thing. We expect you to come prepared to show up on time and be engaged and you know these things, but again, when you hear it from someone who's passed the class, you know that that simple piece of advice, show up and be prepared, is the difference between an A and maybe a C?  

##### Mia, Student; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [00:04:19] 
I know many group chats that I'm in for different communities and I'm in on campus, people will be like, has anyone taken this course? Can you give me tips for it? Can you give me advice on how to approach the material? Can you give me advice on how to study? And so **for her to already facilitate that conversation is really helpful.** It kind of takes a lot of the pressure off of us to feel like we're in this alone. I think that to see other students who have been in this course who have maybe had the same anxieties or concerns that we've had and then still thrive and prosper in the course is very helpful.  

##### Jessica Weiss, PhD [00:04:53] 
You want to have obstacles shared and hurdles overcome, because being new to a campus, or new to a major, or **new to so-called gatekeeping classes can be quite intimidating and disruption occurs for every student**. There could be a failed exam. There could be a lost textbook. **There are a variety of molehills they can really turn into mountains and the students can see that their position is precarious and feel that they risk dropping out and they don't deserve to be there and that, that some kind of failure is a message.** And so if other students are there and talking about failing the first problem set or a D on the first midterm, but finding the study center and finding a study group, or meeting with peers, or going to office hours. All of these stories present little possible pathways and steps that a student who could then face similar difficulties might then take towards success. And they'll always have the student-to-student stories as reference points.

## Counteracting Imposter Phenomenon and Stereotype Threat  
##### Dale Ireland, MA; Lecturer; English Department; California State University, East Bay [00:00:14]
In my classes, I have students create an annotated bibliography that, it's actually an archive of their journey with a research project. But before I have them even start on that, I have them work collaboratively as a group. And so there are small groups that work on a group annotation. They talk about reading with the grain to understand what the author is saying, reading against the grain where they engage and join a conversation with the writer, they talk about different strategies that they can use for annotation, whether they do it by hand or they're doing it by computer and they present their work back to the class. And so this sense of belonging to this group as you're working, it's a safe place to develop those skills that they will eventually transfer to the work that they do individually.  

##### Danial, Student; California State University, East Bay [00:01:05]
I always thought that this has to be perfect, I can't say anything because I don't want to be wrong, so I'm going to stay quiet. But I think, Professor Ireland and my classmates helped me realize that that's not how you go about learning. You have to make mistakes. It's a rigorous, tough process.  

##### Jonathan Cisco, PhD; Associate Director, Teaching for Learning; Assistant Teaching Professor, Learning, Teaching & Curriculum; University of Missouri [00:01:21]
And so what I would like to do is kind of expose some of my own writing and, and show you the process. I do what was called kind of level outlining.  

##### Jonathan Cisco, PhD [00:01:32]
For some students, **the default mindset of academic writing is that we are typing brilliance at the rate of the blinking cursor**, and that's obviously not the case. And showing students early draft, mid-draft writing, particularly when I mess something up, typos in all, or sometimes even making a note to myself is like, this is not working, this section is not working. All of that is in service to helping the students realize that writing is a process.  

##### Jonathan Cisco, PhD [00:02:05]
And say that I know that that literature review, I want it to be 2,300 words, OK? And it's roughly 2,300 words. I don't get held up on this or too much, but I know that, OK, in that literature review, I'm going to talk let's say, for example, I'm going to talk about four sections, four themes, four conversations, and each one of those is going to be around 575 words or so. And then I break it down even more.  

##### Jonathan Cisco, PhD [00:02:28]
When an undergraduate sees that the paper is 2,000, 3,000 words, they understandably could freak out and just really be concerned about something like that. But when they see a process like the level outline, **break it down into manageable chunks**, it starts to become, I can do that.  

##### Lindsey, Student; University of Missouri [00:02:49]
I've always had trouble outlining things all the time, I just never know where to start and just having this set of instructions of how to do it and how to be able to break it down very easily. I would definitely be using those in the future.  

##### Jessica Weiss, PhD; Professor, Director of Faculty Development; Department of History; California State University, East Bay [00:03:07]
**Students need to feel confident as beginners**. They also need to be encouraged to accept that beginners make mistakes. And faculty member, faculty members can express belief in students’ ability and they can do this by simply saying that to the students. **"This class may be hard, but I believe in you and I'm with you every step of the way" can be a great statement to make at the beginning of a class**, and they can continue to express that faith when exam results may show that the learning was difficult.

##### Jennifer Whitley, PhD; Lecturer of Mathematics; Department of Mathematics; Park University [00:03:42]
**Day one is we talk about the growth mindset and brain science that our brain has ability to grow. And I share a lot of Carol Dweck's work** and Jo Boaler, who works more in math education. She has some great videos out there about how even mathematicians have had really hard struggles with math, and I've had really hard struggles with math and so I talk about my struggles and even as a math teacher. So I try to break down those barriers that some people are better, smarter than others. That's not true. And I try to frame that type of community early, early on in the semester.  

##### Jordyn, Student; Park University [00:04:24]
**Ms. Whitley helped develop that mindset by just sharing with her or sharing with the class her past experiences and letting us know how much study time and work she had to put into it.** The math didn't just come easy to her. She had to put forth the work in the effort to retain everything.  

##### Jennifer Whitley, PhD [00:04:40]
And then I think little things throughout the semester when they make mistakes, letting them know that, oh my gosh, I've made that mistake so many times. And other students chime in in the discussion boards that they also make that mistake and recognizing that all that stuff is natural.  

##### Mike Wesch, PhD; Professor of Cultural Anthropology; University Distinguished Teaching Scholar; Department of Sociology, Anthropology, and Social Work; Kansas State University [00:04:57]
And so I'm always trying to bring up examples of these, this research that helps them achieve a growth mindset or some kind of sense that, that they maybe don't have to be defined simply by the grades that they've received in the past.  

##### Mike Wesch, PhD [00:05:14]
**This is my son George, and this is him learning to go downstairs and notice, like, how he just keeps trying and trying. What's going on here? Well, one thing like nobody is telling George, George, you're not a stairs person, you know, so he doesn't have this message in his mind, like, OK, I'm not a stairs person, I'll never do this. Like, I think he thinks he's going to do it. He knows he's going to do it.** There will be times when you're not there yet. It's a journey. It takes time. There's going to be times when you're stumbling down the stairs and you're just not mastered it yet. And I want to be there and tell you, like, yep, you're not there yet. And **I'll try to tell you, like, you know exactly how you stumbled or what went wrong and then you can try again.**  

##### Dale Ireland, MA [00:05:50]
In my classes, we do a lot of work looking at the stories we tell ourselves about who we are as writers, who we are as thinkers, who's telling those stories? Are they our stories or do they belong to somebody else? And as we start looking at those stories, we get a little perspective and understanding of how they might shape how we approach writing. Or maybe we make some choices because we're afraid we're going to hear that thing again that says we don't belong and we shouldn't be here. And so writing is something that feels unsafe, where you can't take risk because those stories of "you don't belong here", "you can't do this" become so internalized.  

##### Alisa Cooper, EdD; English & Journalism Faculty; English, Reading, Journalism & Creative Writing Department; Glendale Community College [00:06:32]
**What I do is I ask for students, for their very first writing assignment in the first week, I ask for them to to give me a reading and writing profile. And in the reading and writing profile, they're basically just asked to write about themselves and in their experience with writing. And once I get those and I read them, I sort of set up some goals that I think they should have. Many of them will say things like, I've never been a good writer. And so I always say to them, "You're a good writer and I want for you to make that an affirmation". If I have a student who does feel like they're not a good writer or who feels beat up through writing classes, you know, I make a note, I put them on a list and throughout the rest of the semester, as I'm giving feedback, that student, let's say that student got an A on the assignment and I'll give a little bit more feedback instead of just good job, I'm like, see, here's a good example of why you should consider yourself a good writer.**  

##### Dale Ireland, MA [00:07:30]
**Whereas they may begin the semester with I'm not a good writer, I can't do this, I always avoid this, as we move through the semester it may be, I don't know how to do this yet.** And so it's open to the possibility of learning.

## Read Aloud, Think Aloud Activity
##### Jonathan Cisco, PhD; Associate Director, Teaching for Learning; Assistant Teaching Professor, Learning, Teaching & Curriculum; University of Missouri [00:00:05]
When students are approaching academic reading, they could approach it from a lot of different ways. In my experience, and I think what the research shows, is that most students, **if they are not taught otherwise, will start at the beginning and go to the end. And if they are not comprehending something, they might just continue to plow through it, hoping that comprehension will go along the way.**  

##### Jonathan Cisco, PhD [00:00:32]
What I want to share with you is kind of one strategy of reading in the social sciences that I hope is going to be useful for you. The strategy is actually, I think it dates out to 1946 maybe, it's the SQ3R. But in short, it's talking about, here's one process of getting through a complex text, typically nonfiction text.  

##### Jonathan Cisco, PhD [00:00:51]
The process I use to help students read challenging text is the Read Aloud, Think Aloud protocol and the Read Aloud, Think Aloud protocol is all about how do I, as a disciplinary expert, read a disciplinary text? Picking a text that you haven't read before, or maybe that has been a really long time since you've read it, something that you're unfamiliar with. It's important for a number of reasons. The first thing is that it makes it a more genuine process. They see where you trip up, they see where you get confused, they see where you have to check your own knowledge set in the reading process. So, we want to make sure that it's a genuine and vulnerable place to, to meet the students.  

##### Jonathan Cisco, PhD [00:01:42]
The first thing that you're going to notice me doing is I'm going to survey this journal article. I'm going to walk through it very quickly and kind of think, OK, what do I not recognize right off the bat? What might I need to go look up before I even try and dive into this thing? And then I'm going to read it as I would normally with, with purpose. I'm going to maybe recite it and review it for me as well. So, I'll open with the purpose.  

##### Jonathan Cisco, PhD [00:02:08]
So when I begin a Read Aloud, Think Aloud, I **first want to think about, OK, what is my purpose? And so I will share my purpose with my students.** So, in this case, why am I reading this journal article? Is it to write a literature review and include that article? Is it to critique it? Is it to talk about it with others? All of those purposes have different processes behind them. I often say my, my purpose dictates my method when I'm when I'm reading.  

##### Jonathan Cisco, PhD [00:02:38]
Our purpose, because of just time, is just going to be I want to be able to discuss the basic elements of this study in a class. Now, one thing that I want you to do as you watch this process, as I want you to take note, if you would, of what kind of disciplinary moves you see me making. What actions am I doing here? I know that you're not in the social sciences and that's cool, but what am I doing? And more importantly, or as importantly, what am I not doing? And so the first thing, obviously, I'm going to look at the title, and sometimes we just don't do that. Sometimes we think about, ah I just want to delve into it and get rid of it. But the "Reading Habits of College Students in the United States". OK, OK, so that's the first thing I think about. I'm also probably going to look, because I'm a scientist, year is important, so I'm going to want to see that this is 2014. This study employed a convergent mixed-method research design. OK, so right away we get the flag. Some of us might be like, uh, right, what? What's that? To investigate reading habits of American college students. To simplify. OK, this study employed some freaky-deaky method to investigate reading habits.

##### Jonathan Cisco, PhD [00:03:45]
So, the reason **I might zero in on something that confused me right up front and then acknowledge, oh, I don't know what they're doing here. And then later on in this think aloud process, going back to it and saying, oh, that's, that's what it is, because that's a genuine process. That is one of the many things that if a student were to read that article, they might get tripped up on.** And if they hadn't seen me get similarly confused by something, that might be a point to where they would just kind of give up or what's worse, I think, is they start to internalize that failure as something wrong with them.  

##### Mason, Student; University of Missouri [00:04:23]
I think something that Dr. Cisco did that really helped me sort of connect and understand how people do stuff and that I'm not alone in not understanding stuff is that **he straight up Google searched some words, like it's not like you need to understand every single word that you read in a text. It's, it's perfectly fine to just go in there and if there's a word that you don't see, be like, hum, I don't understand that and just type it into Google.** It's a perfectly valid way. And I think that Dr. Cisco really validated that.  

##### Jonathan Cisco, PhD [00:04:57]
I had asked you to kind of take note of any sort of moves that I did or didn't do. What kinds of things did you notice I did or didn't do?  

##### Lindsey, Student; University of Missouri [00:05:08]
I noticed, especially at the very beginning when we did the survey, you were able to go through the entire thing and kind of already get your base and let your framework for, like, what you need to discuss. And I feel like, especially for someone who has imposter syndrome, you would be able to like, kind of like slow yourself down and be able to understand exactly what you need to know before even going into it.  

##### Lindsey, Student [00:05:30]
One of the disciplinary moves that I noticed, like first thing off the bat, was in the survey part of the reasoning was that he was able to take the headings and subheadings and go through the entire thing and pretty much get a base and foundation for what the entire thing was about before he even knew what he was reading. And I always think that's very helpful when you have a base knowledge before you go in, because it helps you, you know, you already know the foundation of what you're reading and, at that point, you just need to know details.  

##### Jonathan Cisco, PhD [00:05:59]
And it's just trying to be mindful of when we felt like imposters, when we felt like we were not going to be able to succeed at this. And we did. And then trying to give our students what we wish we had had. I wish someone had walked me through a journal article before I just kind of just plowed through it in the early parts of graduate school. And so the more we can be vulnerable and honest with ourselves on what caused us a great deal of challenge, the better we can be at identifying those processes and breaking them down for students.  

##### Lindsey, Student [00:06:33]
It was like, you know, people think we kind of just spew genius, like just out of the page. And the fact that we were able to go step-by-step to see that they do the same process as we do was so comforting and so great.  

##### Kiana, Student; University of Missouri [00:06:45]
I may not need the extra assistance or I may need it very badly, but having a professor who's willing to show up in that way is going to increase confidence whether the student needs it or not.  

##### Mason, Student [00:06:58]
Dr. Cisco going over those things and showing that, you know, he doesn't have the answers to everything really helps us understand that we don't need to know everything and that we can be learners and understand the world through that lens.

## Expert Insights
##### Sharoni Denise Little, PhD, EdD; Vice Dean/Senior Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Officer; Professor, Business Communication; University of Southern California; CEO, The Strategist Company, LLC [00:00:03] 
**Stereotype threat really is an emotional experience that students who have been historically marginalized, historically stereotyped, often experience when they're in environments, especially around test taking or performing in one's classroom. And so the stereotype threat really is a beginning of imposter syndrome and that internal emotional and mental process takes away from one's performance in that moment. And so if I am in internal dissonance, an internal battle of do I really belong, am I really less smart, am I really a contributor? Then that student is grappling with unnecessary, unwarranted, unvalidated thoughts about, how can I perform? And so what it begins to do is to become somewhat of a self-fulfilling prophecy. It disallows full, innate, authentic opportunities to display one's intellectual ability, one's innate curiosity, one's innate innovation, and the harm, long term and short term, is that we lose out as educators and as educational institutions on the full intellectual, personal contribution of all of our students.**  

##### Narrator [00:01:35] 
When you considered your future looking into your crystal ball with a new instructor, what did you see? Was your future filled with anxiety and doubt about becoming the type of educator and researcher who inspired you? Or did you picture your name on that first research publication? Did you imagine students at graduation expressing gratitude to you for changing their lives? **Albert Bandura's research demonstrates that self-efficacy, belief in yourself, is key for success and increases with mastery experiences, persisting through challenges to achieve goals and verbal persuasion, when someone such as a trusted mentor expresses their belief in your ability.** Not surprisingly, this applies to you and your students.  

##### Santiba D. Campbell, PhD; Associate Professor, Psychology; Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences; Bennett College [00:02:17] 
**So students could suffer from imposter syndrome and not even realize that they're dealing with it. So one of the things that I try to do in class is instead of focusing on imposter syndrome and let's figure out who has and who doesn't, let's take a opposite approach, kind of like going back to the deficit versus asset model. Instead, let's focus on self-efficacy. Let's make sure that everyone has a solid grounding of self-efficacy. And, you know, what do I mean by self-efficacy? Your belief in ability to achieve.** Knowing that you're able to accomplish something. Or simply put, with my students, when I introduce self-efficacy, I tell them think about Bob the Builder. Like, we all know Bob the Builder's famous slogan. They'll immediately say, "Can we fix it? Yes, we can. Can we build it? Yes, we can." What Bob had was self-efficacy for his friends, right? He believed that if him and his friends got together, they could achieve anything. **Self-efficacy is your belief in yourself. If you believe in yourself, you can then achieve everything. Imagine the difference if we all focus on building up these ideas of self- efficacy instead of speculating whether or not students had imposter syndrome.**  

##### Narrator [00:03:28] 
**How might your students picture their future? Do they see themselves completing your course, advancing to the next semester, and graduating? Or are they filled with anxiety and doubt? Many students experience imposter phenomenon when facing challenging tasks or unfamiliar situations. Possible effects, feeling they don't belong and could be discovered as a fraud, social isolation, and decreased academic performance.**  

##### Marlo Goldstein Hode, PhD; Senior Manager, Strategic Diversity Initiatives; University of Missouri - St. Louis [00:03:53] 
**If a student is experiencing imposter syndrome, you may notice that they may not raise their hand to provide an answer. They may not volunteer or seek out positions of leadership. They may not ask for assistance or even making appointments with the instructor. So when you feel like everyone else knows and you don't, you want, you tend to make yourself small instead of reaching for your potential.**

##### Narrator [00:04:24] 
**You can help students build confidence to persist in overcoming challenges by cultivating academic and social belonging. By learning about your students' experiences and communicating your appreciation of them, students feel they belong and are valued. Provide opportunities for community-building among students through group office hours, buddy systems, or discussion groups, giving students comfort in knowing they're not alone in their academic struggles and prompting them to help one another succeed. Bandura's research shows students can feel empowered by seeing others who look like them succeed. Helping students find role models or having past students share their struggles and strategies for success also build self-efficacy. In addition, encourage students to take academic risks and share the benefits of struggling and learning from mistakes. This helps them gain self-confidence to overcome academic challenges.**  

##### Marlo Goldstein Hode, PhD [00:05:18] 
I think part of the idea is to help questions challenge their own thinking by asking questions that will sort of unravel those stereotypes and that imposter syndrome. So you might ask the student, "So you didn't work hard to get here?" "So tell me about a time that you engaged in a challenging task and were successful." **"Have you ever learned from a mistake?"** You know, and maybe just kind of, some of the questions that will counterbalance the sort of negative messaging that that student is giving themselves and balancing that with actual evidence from their lived experience that contradicts that.  

##### Narrator [00:06:03] 
A growing body of research has undercut conventional assumptions that genetics or cultural differences lead some students to perform poorly academically. **Claude Steele, Joshua Aronson and Steven Spencer examined how group stereotypes may impact the academic performance of students. Their work showed that groups of White and Black students scored equally well, with no mention that the test they were taking diagnosed intellectual ability. Yet when researchers told students that it measures intellectual ability, Black students posted lower scores.**  

##### Teresa A. Nance, PhD; Vice President, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion; Chief Diversity Officer; Associate Professor; Villanova University [00:06:35] 
When I think of stereotype threat, I can't help but think of Steele and Aronson. And in particular, I think of an article that Claude Steele did for The Atlantic Monthly. That was the first time I learned about stereotype threat. And one of the things that happened in this article is he talked about that **even Black students at the most rigorous institutions, I believe he was at Stanford at the time, are having trouble being successful. And now these were Black students who were at the very top of the very best high schools, and they came to university and were having trouble. What he found is that students who are minoritized in some way, or in this case Black students who are reminded of the limitations of their social group in the proximity of taking a test, will not do as well on the test if they were not reminded of the limitations of that social group.**  

##### Narrator [00:07:36] 
**Similar results were seen when women were told that a test showed gender differences. In that instance, women performed less well than men. Yet when they were told the tests did not show gender differences, they scored equally well. Steele and Aronson coined the term stereotype threat as a result of this work.**  

##### Santiba D. Campbell, PhD [00:07:54] 
**The language that you use in instructions and directions can decrease the impact of stereotype threat. Is this a test just looking at achievement? Ability? Acknowledgment of understanding? All three of those people tend to use interchangeably. But what we've actually found in the research is that they can be interpreted differently. And that can be a trigger in itself to the student to say, oh, well, women aren't good in math. And if this math test is supposed to measure my mathematical knowledge, I may not be as good in it. As opposed to just saying, you know, "This is a test." Right? It doesn't necessarily have to be diagnostic. I found that fascinating that we could actually see a difference in the outcome based on the language of the directions.**  

##### Narrator [00:08:47] 
**Students experiencing stereotype threat are also at risk of activating high blood pressure, feeling overwhelmed, nervous, and experiencing cognitive overload, all impacting their performance and ability to focus. To reduce stereotype threat use practices that promote a growth mindset about intelligence. ==Share relevant stories of how public figures and past students persevered to overcome challenges.== Normalize academic struggles and mistakes by describing your own struggles and how you learn from your mistakes.**  

##### Teresa A. Nance, PhD [00:09:20] 
I think it's important for students to recognize that we all struggle. I know that sometimes when we have what we're talking about, long papers I will share with students, I just got to revise and resubmit on an article that I have revised, resubmitted at least four times that, clearly I'm not doing something right, but the point is, is that we all struggle at something. I talk to students about, even when I'm given speaking assignments, how long it takes me to write my impromptu remarks, because a lot of times what happens is that, if you're from a first-generation family, if you don't have people who have these kinds of rigorous college experiences in their background, you think that all the people who are there are just flipping right through it and getting everything right off the bat. And, and a lot of times they can't depend upon their peers to tell the truth, because the peers will say, I didn't study for that test. Yes, they did. You know? Or, I knocked this paper off, you know, in a couple of hours. Maybe the first draft they knocked off in the for a couple of hours, but that went through three or four drafts.  

##### Narrator [00:10:35] 
**Guide students in writing reflections about the strategies they used in the past to overcome barriers to success. Build their confidence by incorporating low stakes assessments and assignments that allow students to practice developing skills before a major assessment that requires they demonstrate mastery. After all, the adage, success breeds success, is often true. Encourage revisions and offer feedback that recognizes progress. And most importantly, communicate your belief in students’ ability to succeed. Research shows that what you tell your students about their ability to succeed may matter more than what students personally believe. Your role in helping students see themselves as capable of success cannot be overstated. You truly can make a difference.** 

##### Jennifer Imazeki, PhD; Associate Chief Diversity Officer for Faculty and Staff; Professor of Economics; San Diego State University [00:11:24] 
**The concept of equity mindedness, I believe, was coined, maybe the term was coined by Estela Bensimon at USC. And the way I would explain equity mindedness is instead of focusing on what students are doing or not doing, we turn the focus on what am I, the instructor doing or not doing to support my students or to figure out why they are doing or not doing what whatever it is. So it really when our students are struggling, it it really is about thinking, why are they struggling and what can I, the instructor, do? It's not uncommon for instructors to think about all the reasons why students are struggling that have to do with the student, they're lazy, they're unmotivated, they didn't do the reading, they aren't coming to class and stop there. And it's fine to to start with that, I think. ==But an equity minded instructor takes the next step of saying, why are they doing that thing and what can I do about it?==** If they aren't coming to class, why aren't they coming to class and how can I make coming to class something they want to do, right? Or if they aren't doing the reading, why aren't they doing the reading? How can I find out why they aren't doing the reading? Can I give them incentives to do the reading? Can I help them figure out how to get more out of the reading, right? So there is a somewhat subtle distinction and it really is about taking that extra step of not just here's what my students are doing and here's how they are struggling, but given that this is what my students are doing and given that they're struggling, what am I doing or what could I do to learn more, do more, support them better, that sort of thing?
[[Module 3 Reflecton Assignment]]

## Discussion
How well does Professor Miller build students’ confidence in completing their literature review assignment? What practices from Jerry’s conversation with his colleague Camilla might he implement to better prepare students to complete their assignment? What other strategies might you recommend to build students’ confidence?

I don't think he built confidence at all, and in fact may have hurt it quite a bit. Particularly, the comment about how he had to learn it "for [his] doctorate", both dismisses their concerns, and is irrelevant unless this class is part of a doctorate program. Based on the comments of the students, it sounds like this is in an undergraduate program.

I think his colleague's suggestion of breaking down the assignments into smaller pieces would go far in preparing students to complete the assignment. Also, being clear and direct about the next tangible step to focus on, I found, often helps students who are getting lost in the big picture. Finally, dissmissively telling students to go to the writing center is not helpful. If possible, I would suggest building time into the class to actually take students to the writing center, and/or include early assignments that require a visit to the writing center.
