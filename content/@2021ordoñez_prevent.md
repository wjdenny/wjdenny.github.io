# How To Prevent and Combat Cannabis-Induced Anxiety

[[Miguel Ordoñez]] wrote this article for [[Royal Queen Seeds]].

## Notes
Careful research on this is important because companies like these will take any study that supports their goal of selling products and spin it while ignoring all others.

> But as a 2019 study[9] suggests, the positive effects appear to be prevalent among those who are THC-sensitive in the front part of their brain. Those who are THC-sensitive in the posterior part of the brain appear to experience more anxiety.

So the theory is that because I have more THC receptors in the posterior part of my brain, I feel more anxiety. Could that also be why I feel less anxiety when I try to make the front part of my brain more active through writing and logic? Could that also be why I keep feeling that buzzing feeling in the back of my head?

> Receptor density, for instance, tends to decrease[10] as we grow older. And according to academic Dr Gregory Gerdeman, PhD[11], cannabis could affect people differently depending on their age.

So there could be hope for more calm experiences as I get older.

> As a 2014 study[12] suggests, oestrogen may increase cannabis sensitivity.

> Specifically, oestrogen appeared to have an interaction with THC’s physical soothing qualities.

Hmm. Good reason to try to manage estrogen side effects in my testosterone and/or lose body fat because that also increases estrogen, right?

> Just like with alcohol, people tend to develop a tolerance to cannabis after a period of use. While genetics and the brain’s neural makeup play a role, usage is still the biggest factor.
> 
> Studies suggest that as the brain gets frequently exposed to THC, the CB1 receptors become desensitised[13]. What happens next is a process called internalisation[14], where the receptors retract. Ultimately, it results in a less-intense THC experience.

> Some experts believe four weeks[15] is enough time to repopulate cannabis receptors in the brain back to normal levels. So you don’t even need to abstain for that long!
