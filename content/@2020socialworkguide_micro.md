> [!summary] Summary
> The three established levels of social work practice are micro (individual), mezzo (community), and macro (inter/national). 

## Notes
The *micro* level focuses on support and services to individual clients, including families and small groups such as couples and co-workers.

The *mezzo* level focuses on providing support and services to communities and specific populations, such as neighborhoods, urban youth, immigrants, etc.

The *macro* level focuses on "big picture" advocacy and policy at a state, regional, national, or international level.

> Social workers often move from one practice level to another. For example, a clinical social worker might provide individual counseling, lead a weekly support group, and contribute to lobbying efforts.

> As Powell observes, social work’s versatility contributes to considerable overlap among the practice areas, creating an array of professional possibilities, especially for those with graduate training.

> "While some social workers start with macro practice, many others start their career in micro or mezzo practice and then transition into macro-level practice. After completing a graduate degree in social work, the opportunities are endless," she emphasizes.

> Because careers reflect the interconnectedness of the practice levels, Rice advises students and those early in their careers to avoid pigeonholing themselves into one particular focus. She stresses that social workers must "navigate situations across the levels," because "**==social work practice is as varied as society’s problems==**." Students should attain as much experience as possible across all levels to gain insight into their professional strengths.
