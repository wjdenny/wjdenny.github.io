# "Stealth" Faculty Development in Adopting Plurilingual Disposition: Collaboration on a Student Conference on Language

> [!summary] Summary
> Shuck organized a campus-wide conference led by multilingual students. 

## Notes 
> Helping audience members understand what it means to value multilingual students' knowledge and experiences has been one of my primary strategic goals in organizing this set of presentations ([[2004 Shuck|Shuck, 2004]]). (page 141)

> The resulting increase in the number of instructors participating in planning the Conference allowed us to seize a *kairotic* moment-- a fleeting opportunity to meet a need. Kairos is possible when the responsibility to address a need intersects with a recognition of possible responses that have become visible for any number of reasons ([[2016 Wilber|Wilber, 2016]]).  (page 142)

> One either recognizes the moment and seizes it, or one misses the opportunity and, regretting its passing, reflects on what to pay attention to in the future. (page 142)

> *[[Plurilingualism|plurilingual disposition]]*-- an orientation of openness to linguistic difference as a resource to be drawn upon in communication.  (page 142)

> For those instructors new to teaching multilingual sections, collaborations on the Conference resulted in an unexpectedly quick move toward [[Plurilingualism|plurilingual dispositions]]. (page 142)

> I am not using "stealth" here in the conventional, war-like sense of being intentional but secretive. Rather, I am arguing that such moments of serendipity can be viewed as kairotic moments for exerting agency and can thus become productive means for creating institutional change. (page 142)

> Boise State's U.S.-resident multilingual population is significantly larger, based on estimates from institutional data. A simple query about the language backgrounds of all students during mid-spring 2020 revealed that 1355 students (7.67% of FTE), including international students, indicated that their native language was not English. (page 143)

[[Collecting nuanced data on language use is critical for supporting the diversity efforts of an institution]]

This quote about institutional data got me thinking about [[An Argument For Better Language Data Collection]].

> This is not an estimate of how many English learners we have, as the definition of "native speaker" is widely contested (e.g., [[@2011ruecker_challenging|Ruecker, 2011]]; [[2006 Shuck|Shuck, 2006]]). Moreover, students whose first language was not English may be far more proficient in English than in that native language. Nevertheless, of the 1[,]355 current students who indicated that their native language was not English, only 298 were international students on visas. (page 144)

[[Students who report having English as a second language can still be more fluent in English than any other language]]

> Boise is the larger of the two Idaho cities with long-running refugee resettlement programs. Although languages other than English are spoken in only 8.5% of households in the country where the university of located, in the two most populous countries nearby an average of 16.3% of households speak a language other than English at home (United States Census Bureau, 2019). Twenty-six percent of households in the larger of those counties are Hispanic, according to 2019 U.S. census data. Boise State's local multilingual population thus includes Spanish--English bilingual or Spanish heritage-language students, as well as multilingual students who use English and at least one other language in the home, such as Somali, Dari, Bosnian, and Arabic. (page 144)

> The specific paths that have brought multilingual students to Boise have had a varied impact on their learning of English and their academic writing in any language ([[2004 Bigelow & Tarone|Bigelow & Tarone, 2004]]; [[2009 Matsuda & Matsuda|Matsuda & Matsuda, 2009]]).

> At every turn, I urge faculty across the curriculum to see themselves as having as much responsibility for educating multilingual English learners as they have for educating monolingual native English speakers. If instructors' only strategy is to send English learning to a separate campus office to get help, then the institution as a whole excludes multilingual students from consideration in course design, assessment practices, and admissions procedures, and even from the collective image of who students are ([[2006 Shuck|Shuck, 2006]]). (page 144)

> I decided to embed a conference that the students would name and design. This conference would allow first-year, multilingual students a chance to speak as experts and feel a sense of belonging in the academy. The students would read about language and identity, code-switching, and linguistic discrimination and develop a set of presentations for faculty on their experiences being multilingual. That set of student presentations-- the Boise State Conference on Language, Identity, and Culture-- has been held almost every semester since 2001. Because the Conference is a venue for centering multilingual student voices, it has been an important and very intentional faculty development strategy for shaping the thinking of the audience members who attend. (page 145)

> I have actively cultivated partnerships by identifying potential allies across campus. Such a deliberate strategy is critical to a program's success (e.g., [[2014 Cox|Cox, 2014]]). (page 145)

> For her FLC teaching project, she developed a thoughtfully designed cross-cultural section of Fundamental Concepts in Biology, a general education course, which integrated cultural diversity into course design from the beginning. (page 146)

> Between 2012 and 2017, the total international student population went from approximately 300 to nearly 1[,]000, with Saudi and Kuwaiti students being in the majority. In 2012, many of these students were admitted with International English Language Testing Systems (IELTS) scores of 6.5 and 7.0 (out of 9) are common minimums for admission to U.S. universities for undergraduates. (page 146)

> Student panels on Saudi-U.S. cultural differences (page 146--147)

> Boise State's FYW courses had at one time been administered separately from the pre-FYW, ESL writing courses despite being housed in the same department. Depending on placement, a student might have taken up to three semesters of ESL course before being eligible for the first required FYW course, English 101. (page 147)

> 101P (101 Plus) was developed by the FYW Program in part as a solution to the problem of non-credit "remediation." Modeled partly after the Accelerated Learning Program ([[Adams, et al. (2009)|Adams, Gearhart, Miller, & Roberts, 2009]]), English 101P offers a small cohort of students within a 101 class an additional hour of instruction and support each week. Many multilingual Boise State students, however, including some U.S.-resident English learners and many of the new Saudi and Kuwaiti students, needed much more than one hour of support. I therefore adapted the 101P structure by piloting a 6-credit multilingual section of English 101, with significant support built in to help students meet FYW learning outcomes while developing their English beyond "modest user" levels. Called English 101M (M = multilingual), the course has a per-section cap of 15 students and a supplemental learning assistant assigned to each section ([[2018 Shuck & Wilber|Shuck & Wilber, 2018]]). (page 147)

> the Conference, I highlighted for them its central goals:
> - Creating a space for student agency in choosing how to present themselves-- whether they highlighted their multilingual, multicultural identities or identities as outsiders in an English-dominant context;
> -  Demonstrating to newer English learners, faculty, and monolingual peers the value of multicompetence-- the discursive, cultural, rhetorical, and linguistic competencies one has by virtue of being multilingual ([[1999 Cook|Cook, 1999]]);
> - Combating deficit discourse ([[2013 Canagarajah|Canagarajah, 2013]]; [[2014 Cox|Cox, 2014]]; [[2019 Weaver|Weaver, 2019]]); and
> - Allowing multilingual students to cultivate a sense of belonging in this English-dominant environment.
> (page 148)

> Indeed, many of the international student presenters tended to draw stark contrasts between the U.S. and their home countries, ignoring the internal linguistic and cultural variation within every society. In this sense, a pedagogical approach might be linguistically inclusive without being plurilingual. That is, a teacher might intentionally modify their classroom and assessment practices to allow students at different English proficiency levels to succeed, without necessarily drawing on students' other language resources. (page 149)

> one of the more experienced instructors described to her colleagues an assignment she had developed for one of my workshops. **Each student in her class would choose a word in a language other than English that meant something to them, teach their audience the word, and write an essay reflecting on its personal significance.** (page 149)

[[There is a writing activity that asks students to explain and reflect on a meaningful word or phrase in their first language]]

Another one I thought of was "[[What do Americans know about your country]]?" as a way to open the door to different cultural perspectives.

> a presentation about computer keyboards with different writing systems, including photos of Korean keys and screenshots of documents that showed right-to-left cursor movement in Arabic. After the Conference was over that semester, several audience members, including long-time faculty in attendance, commented that they had never considered how technology deals with other writing systems. Speeches by themselves would not have had the same impact without the plurilingual visual element. (page 150)

> The use of Twitter in this context was the brainchild of then-Boise State faculty member [[Emily Simnitt]], whose work is also in this volume. She leveraged the ease of our Middle Eastern student cohort had with smartphone technology in order to highlight differences between Twitter literacy and academic literacy. Paradoxically, the presentations that emerged blurred distinctions between these two domains. The plurilingual-- and multimodal-- communicative resources that the instructors recognized crated a multi-voiced space where those resources became rhetorical assets for the student presenters. (page 150)

[[Survey students about their technology and language usage and consider developing lessons and support around that knowledge]]

> the faculty came to increasingly focus their assessment of student work on rhetorical effectiveness and contributions of labor than on native-speaker "standards" of good writing. (page 151)

> adopted Inoue's (2019) [[Labor-based grading contracts|labor-based]] [[Grading Contracts|contract grading]] model. Labor-based grading counteracts assessment models shaped by monolingualist, deficit-oriented language ideologies ([[2013 Canagarajah|Canagarajah, 2013]]; [[@2022inoue_labor|Inoue, 2019]]). (page 151)

> Other collaborations ... such as working with the Director of Admissions to redesign the application for admission so that the institution can track U.S.-resident students who need language support. (page 151)

> Another key to the development of plurilingual pedagogies is the shift in the export-novice relationship. Discussed in detail by [[Kibler (2010)]], the bilingual students' expertise as they brokered interactions with their monolingual teachers revealed that the use of students' fist languages in an L2 classroom blurred traditional boundaries of "expert" and "novice" roles. The instructors in Kibler's study and in this cohort at Boise State had to be willing to give up the role as primary knower and to learn instead from student experts. Moreover, overly valuing students' linguistic and rhetorical expertise facilitates the use of that expertise in the development of their students' writing ([[@2021enright_latinx|Enright & Bencomo Garcia, this volume]]). (page 152)

> I urge readers to keep an eye out for *kairos*. As [[Wilber (2016)]] writes, opportunities for action arise when a need to respond to a situation intersects with a sense of urgency, an awareness of one or more possible responses, and a sense of responsibility to act. (page 152)

> [[1990 Tan|Amy Tan's "Mother Tongue" (1990)]] or [[1987 Anzaldúa|Gloria Anzaldúa's "How to Tame a Wild Tongue" (1987)]]. An important goal of such discussions should be to shift the focus "from deficits to strings, emphasizing what L2 students can do with language rather than what they cannot" ([[2014 Cox|Cox, 2014]], p 304). (page 153)

>[[ Ferris (2009)]] and [[Kroll (2006)]] have described some sites where acknowledging linguistic diversity is important across an institution. Those include writing placement processes, faculty and tutor preparation for working with multilingual students, nuanced language diversity data beyond just students' native languages, a process for identifying students who need language support, and curricula across campuses that account for the strengths and language needs of multilingual students. Advocates should, at a minimum, understand where the needs are, how to address those needs, and what models for linguistic inclusion and support exist across the country. (page 153)
