## Notes
Lessons of Design
https://lessons.design/

> In certain cultures, there is a tradition of couples renewing wedding vows every new decade to remind themselves why they’re together in the first place. It is a way to reaffirm one’s commitment, and it can be done for any type of relationship between a person and their object of affection.
>
> After almost 20 years of doing the same thing over and over (i.e. designing digital products), I needed to stop for a second and put down on paper what it is that I find compelling about our craft.

This is an interesting idea. I can consider doing something similar for teaching. 

[[Why I'm still teaching ESL]]

> Find what’s magical about the framework you're creating, the thing that no other product is doing, and then make that thing scandalously obvious. Stretch that attribute to its limit—right before it breaks. That's how you create things people will remember.

I wonder if this applies to teaching, as well. If we have a backwards design; make that obvious. If we design for active learning; make that obvious.

> Whenever there is an argument between two ideas, find the third idea.

> Take breaks. The best ideas will come to you while you are out on a run, brewing coffee, or any other time when your brain is not obsessing about work.

> Find the ideas that scare you. Invite them over. Give them a try. At a minimum, even if they don’t work, you will be less scared to try them next time.

What teaching or instructional design ideas scare me? Being observed; having my work criticized. I don't think that's what was meant, though.

> If you’re trying to explain what your product/feature does and your find yourself using the words “and” or "also" halfway through the sentence, something is wrong. It might be trying to do too many things for too many people.

> Framing works like a placebo. If you present the same design to two groups of people (with and without framing), the group who was introduced to the framing is certainly more likely to buy into your idea—even though the designs are exactly the same.

> When you get people to agree with your framing, even if they disagree with some of your tactical choices that follow, the conversation will be much easier.

> There are hundreds of different ways to frame your designs before you share them: with a conceptual name, a short sentence, a moodboard, a story, a video, a poem, a metaphor, a drawing, a framework, a datapoint, a powerful quote—you name it. Trust your intuition and find the format that 'feels right' for each context and audience.

> Learning to frame your ideas is learning to see. The exercise of looking at a design (whether finished or unfinished) and being able to rationalize why it looks the way it does is one of the most powerful tools on a designer’s belt.

> When you present your work, stop describing what’s on the screen. Talk about how that experience will help users. Talk about how it will help reach business goals. Talk about what inspired you to arrive at that solution. Talk about anything other than giving people the unrewarding “real estate tour”, where you describe exactly what they are already seeing on screen. Design the experience you want your audience to have.

This would apply to any presentation, not just design. Data analytics, teaching, etc.

> Digital product design is a pretty ~boring~ scientific discipline, full of rational thinking, KPIs and metrics talk. Don’t forget to bring humanity and personality to the product you are creating.

> When you find inconsistencies in other people's work, let them know. Ideally, in private. They might be a little embarrassed first, but they will thank you later.

Point out flaws in private.

> "You can't use up creativity. The more you use, the more you have."
>
> —Maya Angelou

> Transgressions are a product of love. It’s never about breaking the system for lack of discipline or oversight. That’s irresponsible. It’s about loving and understanding the system so well, and so much, that you feel an urge to push it further.

> “You have to really believe not only in yourself; you have to believe that the world is actually worth your sacrifices."
> —Zaha Hadid

> Strive for progress. Deliver something every day that will take you closer to that improved, final state.

> Avoid making the same mistakes; try to make new mistakes whenever possible.

> Have the audacity to seek for joy at work. A positive attitude towards yourself and others will make work feel less like work.

> Criticize in private, praise in public. You will get way better results when you elevate good behavior than when you punish bad behavior.

> Stop asking for a seat at the table, or to be involved in certain conversations. The so called “table” doesn’t exist. Instead, find ways to add so much value that no one will forget to invite you next time an important conversation is happening.

Solid career advice, and has been the only thing that has worked for me so far.

> Stop asking people for anything. Start giving more than asking. People will naturally gravitate around you.
