# This is How I take Podcast Notes in Obsidian

> [!summary] Summary
> They suggest taking fleeting notes, then atomize notes, and develop those as evergreen notes. This is similar to how I handle text sources, but using my own notes from the podcast instead of quotes from the text.

One thing they do that I am curious about is using tags in text similar to Twitter. I like the approach, but I don't like the tag clutter that comes with it. I need to do more thinking about the nature of [[Tags versus Notes]].
