# Positioning Bilingualism as an Asset in Rural High Schools

## Notes
> Rural communities have seen increased diversity in recent decades, and rural schools serve roughly 250,000 students officially classed as English Language Learners (ELL) ([[Showalter et al. (2017)|Showalter et al., 2017]]) (page 95)

> While *rural* is notoriously hard to define, I used the National Center for Education Statistics school locate system as guidance, focusing on schools from "Town, Distant" to "Rural, Remote" in towns of less than 10,000 people. (page 109)

> multilingual learners may face very different environments depending on the school they attend, even when the school may be dedicated to serving multilingual student success, success that is often defined in terms of English acquisition (a tendency certainly not isolated to rural schools) (page 95)

> if an area is seeing a relatively recent demographic shift, it is likely they do not have diversity among their teaching staff and, therefore, lack the teaching capacity to support students' plurilingual practices. (page 96)

[[Schools with recent demographic shifts often lack the diversity in faculty to support multilingual students]]

> For instance, residents are more likely to believe that immigrants increase crime rates (41%) compared to their urban residents (32%) and are more likely to believe that immigrants take jobs from the native population (62% vs. 46%) ([[2013 Garcia & Davidson|Garcia & Davidson, 2013]]). (page 96)

[[People in rural areas and small towns are more likely to believe that immigrants increase crime rates and take jobs from locals]]

> In a survey of teachers in a largely rural, white state, the majority of the respondents  either agreed with (45%) or felt neutrally (30%) about the statement, "It is the responsibility of ELL students to adapt to American culture and school life" ([[2004 Walker, Shafer, & Iams|Walker, Shafer, & Iams, 2004, p. 146]]). (page 96)

[[Rural teachers are more likely to believe that ELL students should be responsible for adapting to American culture and lifestyles]]

> Even if teachers have interest in more fully embracing students' plurilingualism, community pressure via the school board or school leaders may prevent them from a more innovative embrace such as the development of dual language programs. Multilingual learners may also face prejudice from other students, which can negatively impact their desire to be an engaged member of the school community. ([[2019 Ruecker|Ruecker, 2019]]) (page 96).

> Various scholars have emphasized the importance of embracing students' languages and cultures but have noted the absence of such an embrace in traditional classrooms. [[Valenzuela (1999)]] describes a predominantly Mexican American high school in Texas that largely ignored students' languages and cultures, leading to a generally unsuccessful education environment. Elsewhere, [[2005 de Jong & Harper|de Jong and Harper (2005)]] note how English-only messaging is too common in mainstream classrooms and explained how this practice can serve to demotivate students (p. 115) (page 97)

[[English-only policies in schools are very common and have negative consequences for students]]

> Pushing back against the status quo, scholars in education and writing studies have increasingly recognized the value of developing students' bilingualism. For instance, [[2010 García & Kleifgen|García and Kleifgen (2010)]] have argued that the term "emergent bilingual," now commonly used among education scholars, highlights students' bilingualism as a "cognitive, social, and educational resources" (p. 3). (page 97)

[[Emergent bilingual as a descriptor for students who speak another language and are learning English focuses on the assets they bring to the classroom]]

> If a student perceives that their school is not valuing their background, then they are less likely to be motivated and invest in the learning process. [[2013 Stille & Cummins|Stille and Cummins (2013)]] found that multilingual learners who drew on their home languages "wrote stories that were quantitatively longer" and "qualitatively much richer and more representative of their ideas than text that they could have written in English at this stage in their learning" (p. 634) (page 97)

[[Students who are permitted to use their other languages are able to write longer and higher quality papers in English]]

> Early models established that two-way students had the highest average English reading performance, followed by developmental, then transitional students" (p. 506). (page 98)

> This chapter draws on the data from a larger study for which I visited six rural schools with a goal to examine how they were supporting their multilingual immigrant populations. (page 98)

> He [the principle] also expressed frustration with the testing and the state pushing students off Spanish tests after a few years like they just magically learn that quickly. He emphasized that they try to ensure they have access as long as they can to the Spanish tests. (page 99)

> This aligns with [[2010 García & Kleifgen|García and Kleifgen's (2010)]] point that bilingual learners "continue to be assessed prematurely with high-stakes instruments that confound academic language and content and that do not align with their language practices" (p. 108). (page 99)

[[Multilingual students are often tested with academic language before they are ready]]

> "If you pass the class and when you graduate, you get [a] stamp on your diploma that says that you're certified like bilingual. And I really would want to pass that class to get that on my diploma." (page 102)

[[Proficiency in multiple languages can be shown as an additional designation on students' diplomas]]

> I noted how one students asked what "persuade" meant and the teacher turned to another student to help out with the translation. (page 102)

> At another school I visited as part of my research, a BL reported being chastised when speaking Spanish to another student to help her access course content. (page 102)

> Of particular note here is her concern that students might get the impression that Ms. Lujan doesn't want them to use Spanish. (page 106)

> clearly situated the onus of supporting BLs on herself and the school and not on the students themselves. (page 106)

> Administrators have a strong ability to set the tone for the way a school serves its multilingual learners. If they only have a perfunctory understanding of laws and take a technical implementation approach, they can obstruct "social justice for [their] students" ([[2019 Mavrogordato & White|Mavrogordato & White, 2019, p. 24]]). If they focus too narrowly on academic outcomes and test scores, "this can have ripple effects that cause teachers and staffs to view ELL students as a burden on the school system and foster mistrust of the school system among ELL students and their families" ([[Showalter et al. (2017)|Showalter et al., 2017, p. 45]]). (page 106)

[[If not careful in their approach, administrators can erode multilingual students confidence in the school system and promote deficit-thinking among faculty]]

> Here is a list of some ways that rural school administrators can support students' multilingual development and also take into consideration the constraints that many rural schools often face: (page 106)

> Build community linguistic resources ... rural schools may only offer entry-level Spanish classes designed for monolingual English students. However, as noted by the Mineral HS administration, more advanced Spanish classes give bilingual learners an opportunity to excel and benefit from their L1 knowledge in school. ... Language instruction should not stop with students: building up linguistic resources among teachers, administrators, and parents is also beneficial. (page 106)

> [[Center for Advanced Research on Language Acquisition]] (CARLA) at the [[University of Minnesota]] (page 107)

> [[Immigrant Learning Center]] is another organization that offers webinars for educators (<https://www.ilctr.org/>) (page 107)

> Shift to a plurilingual reality in standards, tests, and textbooks. While not discussed in detail here, it was evident that many teachers at the other schools I visited were dependent on programs like Rosetta Stone or other textbooks to guide students' language learning. Some teachers indicated that their narrow focus on English acquisition was driven further by the limited time students had to pass state tests in English. As long as standards, tests, and textbooks continue to promote and reward monolingualism, we can expect limited change in classrooms, especially among teachers without more robust training and experience in multiliteracy development.
