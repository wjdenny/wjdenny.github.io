Punctuality is another white habit of mind often imposed on students (of color) in ESL classrooms. 

On late assignments and the future career appropriateness argument. Essentially, I don't know their future job or what their future boss is like, and likely neither do they. They'll understand the importance of timeliness in American culture, but its not my place to enforce a hypothetical boss's standards in a place of learning.
