# A Transmodal Framework for Teaching Multimodal Composing Practices to Multilingual Students

> [!summary] Summary
> Mina (2021) works with students in writing across multiple digital modes and reflects on their experiences.

## Notes
> They bring a wide range of digital practices, communicative resources, and educational and non-educational experiences with technologies. (p. 45)

[[Students come to the classroom with a range of communicative and technological abilities and educational experiences]]

> our educational institutions have yet to respond genuinely to the resources multilingual students bring to our classrooms by exploring learners' interests or their choices of media, genre, and modes, particularly those developed outside formal education settings. (p. 45)

> **I describe that work as transmodal, rather than multimodal, pedagogy because the latter indicates "selecting from a menu" of modalities** ([[2015 Horner, Selfe, & Lockridge|Horner, Selfe, & Lockridge, 2015]]), which doesn't capture the dynamic work of working across modes and media that happened in my classes. (p. 45)

> [[2015 Horner, Selfe, & Lockridge|Horner, Selfe, and Lockridge]]'s conception of transmodality as "awareness and production practices" of "work across boundaries of ... modality" (p. 46)

> plurilingualism as it allows students to "use a repertoire of communicative resources" (The Council of Europe as cited in Cenoz & Gorter, 2013, p. 594). (p. 46)

> In the survey data, here was a **confusing discrepancy between students' awareness of the term "multimodal composing" prior to the course and their reported real-life experiences actually composing multimodal projects.** (p. 47)

[[Researchers have found that students often compose across modalities without realizing it]]

> gaps in students' prior writing knowledge, specifically the **absence of "key writing concepts" which may explain students' confusion** at the term multimodality ([[2012 Robertson, Taczak, and Yancey|Robertson, Taczak, & Yancey, 2012]]) (p. 47)

> **==Instructors should be more inclusive in their use of jargon by deconstructing the term==** (p. 47)

[[Teachers should break down technological terms so that all students can understand them]]

> there is an ethical dimension of this recommendation because **exploring prior knowledge illuminates the multimodal skills that students need** but haven't had the chance to acquire or practice outside school and ==**what role the school should play in making these skills accessible and available for students**== ([[2015 van Leeuwen|van Leeuwen, 2015]]). (p. 48)

[[Exploring data on technology usage can identify gaps in students access and knowledge of critical tools]]

> [[Belcher (2017)]] noted that engaging multilingual students in guided multimodal work in the writing classroom connects "learners' out-of-class practices" and prepares them for the digitally mediated work that they will do in other disciplines and in their careers later (p. 82) (p. 48)

> [[2014 Hafner|Hafner's (2014)]] findings highlight the **value of ==exploring multilingual students' prior knowledge and experiences with multimodal practices as a means to determine possible areas for target instructions and scaffolding**==. (p. 48)

> **when students realizes the similarities between the new task and their prior experience, they bring that experience into play in the new task** ([[2000 Bransford, Pellgrino, & Donovan|Bransford, Pellegrino, & Donovan, 2000]]). (p. 50)

> It's worth cautioning here that being responsive to students' needs doesn't mean starting from scratch or creating whole new course materials every semester; rather, it means adjusting the materials, expanding on some concepts, and cutting redundant materials and concepts with which they are already familiar. (p. 50)

> **scaffolding activities, or those mini-assignments that break down the multimodal composing practices into small and more manageable stages**. (p. 52)

[[Scaffolding is a technique where we break down a complex skill into smaller parts to help students reach the more complex goal]] ^e305b8

> My integration of metacognitive activities was informed by prior research ([[2016 Taczak & Robertson|Taczak & Robertson, 2016]]) that concluded that **when students engage in this reiterative rhetorical reflection, they are more likely to answer the "why?" question about their rhetorical choices, how these rhetorical choices would translate into actual writing, how all these decisions affect the writing process and learning, and how this learning will affect future writing situations.** (p. 54) 

[[Engaging in reflection on multiple iterations of their work helps students understand the nuances of rhetorical choices and how they translate into writing]]

> Inviting students to reflect on their prior knowledge with multimodality, connecting them to their current experiences in the FYW class, and predicting future implications of these experience fosters backward-reaching and forward-reaching of prior knowledge transfer ([[2018 Shepherd|Shepherd, 2018]]) into the FYW class and from that class to future writing settings.
