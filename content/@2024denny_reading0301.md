### Chapter 13
[[@2017harrison_envisioning|Re-envisioning Faculty Development When Multilingualism is the New Norm: Conversations on First-Year Writing at a Hispanic-Serving University]]

Harrison discusses the Universal Design for Learning movement and argues that, due to its association with disability studies, may imply that “second language students have a deficit to overcome.” To what extent does UDL highlight barriers for specific groups as opposed to removing them for everyone (i.e., curb-cut effects).

### Chapter 14
[[@2017monty_transitional|Transitional Access and Integrated Complexity: Interconnecting People, Research, and Media for Transnational Writing Students]]

Monty, Holt, & Charlton quote Green (2012) to point out that students “rarely [ask] for help from someone based on their position” and instead rely on previous history (p. 207). What strategies could Kirkwood use to change this behavior or work with it in order to help students feel more comfortable asking for help?

Monty, Holt, & Charlton (citing Meng-Fen, Hoffman, & Borengasser, 2013) states that very few faculty use social media in courses. In what ways could Kirkwood faculty use social media to engage with resident multilingual students?
### Chapter 15
[[@2017graban_teaching|Teaching Multilingualism, Teaching Identification: Embracing Resident Multilingualism as a Curricular Paradigm]]

Many chapters discussed the pros and cons of labeling and tracking multilingual students. Kirkwood "ELA students" are tracked to some extent until they pass ELA courses, and international students maintain a connection to Global Learning through their international student advisor. To what extent can and should Kirkwood engage in tracking of linguistic minority students? Who should make use of that information?
### Chapter 16
[[@2017ortmeierhooper_internationalization|Internationalization and the Place of Resident ML Students: Identifying Points of Leverage and Advocacy]]

Lizotte and Portanova (Ortmeier-Hooper et al., p. 232) writes that many ESOL and FYC courses are taught by contingent faculty. At Kirkwood, At least 60% of instructional staff in Global Learning/ELA are adjunct faculty and at least 40% in CEM. What sort of impact does this have on the experience of our resident multilingual students? Do faculty (or faculty unions) have any power to advocate for change in the quantity or required training of faculty?
