# ESL, Ideology, and the Politics of Pragmatism

> [!summary] Summary
> ESL instruction is inherently ideological and denying this only serves to support the current dominant ideology.

## Notes
> "all forms of ESL instruction are ideological, whether or not educators are conscious of the political implications of their instructional choices"

> "Educators who do not acknowledge or discuss their ideology are not politically neutral; they simply do not highlight their ideology" 

> "[[Pennycook (1989)]], [[1991 Raimes|Raimes (1991a)]], [[Shor (1992)]], and [[Simon (1992)]]. According to [[Berlin (1988)]], "a way of teaching is never innocent. Every pedagogy is imbricated in ideology" (p. 492)." 

> "Shor asserts that there can be no neutrality in education because it is a "contested terrain where people are socialized and the future of society is at stake" ([[1992 Shor|Shor, 1992]], p. 13)." 

[[Education is never ideological neutral]]
[[Ideological neutrality in education only serves to support the current dominant ideologies]]

> "Which books are read, ignored, or banned; which topics are highlighted or omitted; how school monies are allocated; who is hired, fired, or promoted; how students and teachers talk in the classroom are all areas of debate and contention." 

> "The politics of education is also revealed in stratification: "offering different kinds of education to different groups of people" ([[1991 Auerbach|Auerbach, 1991]], p. 3). Some students are tracked in to high-level, challenging classes while others are prepared in vocational classes for low-skill, low-pay jobs ([[1985 Oakes|Oakes, 1985]])." 

> "Being unaware of the political implications of one's choices, or claiming that those choices are neutral, does not mean that one's pedagogy is free of ideology. Rather, it means that one has chosen to "deny the political nature of schooling" which is akin to" articulating an ideological position in favor of the status quo ([[1989 Pennycook|Pennycook, 1989]], p. 591)." 

> "all forms of education are political because they can enable or inhibit the questioning habits of students, thus developing or disabling their critical relation to knowledge, schooling and society" ([[1992 Shor|Shor, 1992]], p. 13)" 

> "We can present subject matter as facts to be memorized, information to be absorbed, and skills to be practiced without critical questioning of the material or society. Or we can invite students to participate actively in the production of knowledge, to study their learning and social condition" 

> "On the other hand, traditional teaching that presents knowledge as facts, interpretations, or skills delivered to students is also ideological but its politics are less obvious because it fits into the normative status quo." 

> "[[1989 Howard & Dedo|Howard and Dedo (1989)]] warn of the dangers of ignoring ideology in ESL teaching. They argue that by failing to acknowledge the politics of textbooks, teaching approaches, and educational institutions, ESL composition teachers have relinquished power, accepting the role of gatekeepers and second-class citizens in the academic community: "By telling ourselves that the choices we make between pedagogies are based on objective, scientific, rational grounds rather than on political or ideological ones, we have promoted our own disempowerment, allowing larger government or academic institutions to determine the pedagogies we will choose and develop" (p. 3)."  

[[It is dangerous to ignore the ideologies inherent in TESOL]]

This is powerful, and may take some time to digest. I don't need to be the one writing the exams, students can learn to develop their own standards and ways of measuring them. What would that look like? Also, this could be related to the way community colleges struggle to be taken seriously. They are in a position to transform education both with and for un/mis-represented populations.

> "Their studies of survival ESL, competency-based ESL ([[1986 Auerbach|Auerbach, 1986]]; [[1985 Auerbach & Burgess|Auerbach & Burgess, 1985]]), and of the functional curriculum of U.S. Refugee Processing Centers ([[1986 Tollefson|Tollefson, 1986]]) include analyses of funding, curriculum decision making, and assessment procedures" 

> "For example, by analyzing a list of "competencies" from Refugee Processing Center curricula, [[Tollefson (1986)]] found that students are encouraged to "consider themselves fortunate to find minimum-wage employment, regardless of their previous education" (p. 656), and on the whole, the competencies "attempt to inculcate attitudes and values that will make refugees passive citizens who comply rather than complain, accept rather than resist, and apologize rather than disagree" (p. 657)." 

[[ESL students are being ideologically trained to accept their position as low-wage workers]]

> "They challenge claims that these tests give valid information about students' linguistic needs and wonder if the tests actually function to shrink the pool of ESL students entering credit bearing courses, denying to many equal access to mainstream college education ([[1991 Benesch|Benesch, 1991]]; [[1990 Raimes|Raimes, 1990]])."  Accepting that we do not have control over national higher education funding programs and their restrictions, we can still say that every student who comes in has the same right to attempt a program of study, regardless of their linguistic background or immigration status. If a student believes they have the ability to keep up in an English-medium college program, they should be allowed to try. It should be the college's duty to support students who may struggle and need some help, not hold them back.

I've heard the counter argument that it should be the college's job to help a student avoid wasting their time and money on programs they are not ready for. But I still agree with Benesch here. Who are we to stop them? We can give advice and offer support, but we have no right to stop them.

> "These literacy demands are not problematized in the EAP literature but are instead presented as positive artifacts of a normative academic culture into which ESL students should be assimilated" 

> "[[Johns (1990)]] contrasts the notion that "it is the academy that must change to adapt to the many cultures that the students represent" (a notion she seems to reject) with the approach of "other, seemingly more realistic \[emphasis added\], teachers and researchers \[who\] attempt to understand both what academic literacy means, and how best to introduce it into English for Academic Purposes... classes" 

> "For Santos, the self-professed pragmatism of many EAP advocates indicates an avoidance of ideology. However, I believe it actually indicates an accommodationist ideology, an endorsement of traditional academic teaching and of current power relations in academia and in society" 

> "All assume that it is unrealistic to expect the university to adapt itself to the cultures, worldviews, and languages of nonnative-speaking students and that it is realistic to accommodate students to the content and pedagogy of mainstream academic classes"

> "The didactic tradition which authorizes faculty to lecture and assign text books and requires students to take notes, ask an occasional question, and take exams is not challenged in the EAP literature" 

> "There are very few example in the EAP literature of a critical orientation to academic content or challenges to the information-processing model of the traditional lecture class, exceptions being [[Benesch (1992)]], [[Haas, Smoke, & Hernandez (1991)]], and [[1991 Raimes|Raimes (1991a)]]." 

> "The 'conversations' I want to help my students join are not the conversations going on in the academy. These are often restricted, artificial, irrelevant, and-let's be frank-boring. I refuse to look at my students as primarily history majors, accounting majors, nursing majors. I much prefer to think of them and treat them as people whose most important conversations will take place outside the academy, as they struggle to figure out how to live their lives- that is, how to vote and love and survive, how to respond to change and diversity and death and oppression and freedom. (p. 320)" 

[[ESL students may be better served by practical information related to their needs than academic language]]

> "However, the good intentions and hard work of EAP researchers may actually make life harder for both ESL faculty and students because of EAP's accommodation to traditional academic practices which limit the participation of nonnative-speaking students in academic culture. The politics of pragmatism leads to a neglect of more inclusive and democratic practices, such as negotiating the curriculum and collaborative learning because these are rarely practiced in non-ESL classes." 

Here's an idea, what about a lesson where students [[Design a class for people to take before moving to the United States]]

> "If ESL had greater academic status, with tenure-bearing lines, full-credit courses, and representation on important faculty committees, it would not need to justify its existence by serving other departments. Freed from the responsibility of making our colleagues' textbooks and lectures comprehensible, EAP could develop a critical ESL curriculum whose impact would be felt across the campus. We could, as [[Boyer (1990)]] suggests, negotiate academic curricula responsive to urgent social, economic, and political issues, rather than serving one that is so narrowly focused on career preparation" 

> "they embrace an accommodationist ideology that aims to assimilate ESL students uncritically into academic life and U. S. society ([[1991 Auerbach|Auerbach, 1991]],p. 7)."
