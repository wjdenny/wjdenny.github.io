# Building a Second Brain: A Proven Method to Organize Your Digital Life and Unlock Your Creative Potential


> [!summary] Summary
> - [[The Second Brain system combines several personal knowledge management techniques along with those developed by its creator, Tiago Forte]]

## Notes

### Introduction: The Promise of a Second Brain
> The field of PKM emerged in the 1990s to help university students handle the huge volume of information they suddenly had access to through Internet-connected libraries. It is the individual counterpart to Knowledge Management, which studies how companies and other organizations make use of their knowledge.

> Other popular terms for such a system include *Zettlekasten* (meaning: "slip box") in German, coined by influential sociologist Niklas Luhmann). *Memex* (a word invented by American inventor Vannevar Bush), and *digital garden* (named by popular online creator Anne-Laure Le Cunff).

[[Personal knowledge management has a long history]]

### Chapter 1: Where It All Started
>> Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them
>> --David Allen, author of Getting Things Done

> I took out my journal and began to write what I was feeling and thinking. I wrote out the history of my condition, through my own lens and in my own words, for the first time.

I should do some similar digging through the history of my own [[Anxiety]] and [[Depression]] conditions.

> I began to research how breathing, nutrition, vocal habits, and even past experiences in childhood can be manifested in the nervous system.

> improving my diet and regular meditation

> once made digital, notes were no longer limited to short, handwritten scribbles-- they could take any form, including images, links, and files of any shape and size.

> I taught the older students the basics of personal productivity-- how to keep a schedule, how to take notes in class, and how to set goals and plan their education.

Can I do similar things for my students? [[Semester review notes (2022-23 Fall)]]

> I started to realize that [my collection of notes] could be a business asset as well.

> I learned from one of the reports we published that the value of physical capital in the US--land, machinery, and buildings for example--is about $10 trillion, but that value is dwarfed by the total value of *human* capital, which is estimated to be five to ten times larger. Human capital includes "the knowledge and the knowhow embodied in humans-- their education, their experience, their wisdom, their skills, their relationships, their common sense, their intuition."

> My experience managing my chronic condition had taught me a way of getting organized that was ideal for solving problems and producing results now, not in some far-off future.

It doesn't seem like Forte would use separate vaults (re: Obsidian forum question about separate vaults); but then again, later he does say that sensitive information should not be in the PKM at all.

### Chapter 2: What is a Second Brain?
> > We extend beyond our limits, not by revving our brains like a machine or bulking them up like a muscle-- but by strewing our world with rich materials, and by weaving them into our thoughts.
> > --Annie Murphy Paul, author of *The Extended Mind*

> According to the *New York Times*, the average person's daily consumption of information now adds up to a remarkable 34 gigabyes.

> A separate study cited by the *Times* estimates that we consume the equivalent of 174 full newspapers' worth of content each and every day, five times higher than in 1986.

> Instantaneous access to the world's knowledge through the Internet was supposed to education and inform us, but instead it has created a society-wide poverty of attention.

> Research from Microsoft shows that the average US employee spends 76 hours per year looking for misplaced notes, items, or files.

> And a report from the International Data Corporation found that 26 percent of a typical knowledge worker's day is spent looking for and consolidating information spread across a variety of systems. Incredibly, only 56 percent of the time are they able to find the information required to do their jobs.

> In other words, we go to work five days per week, but spend more than one of those days on average just looking for the information we need to do our work. Half the time, we don't even succeed in doing that.

> Every bit of energy we spend straining to recall things is energy not spent doing the thinking that only humans can do: inventing new things, crafting stories, recognizing patterns, following our intuition, collaborating with others, investigating new subjects, making plans, testing theories.

> The practice of writing down one's thoughts and notes to help make sense of the world has a long legacy. For centuries, artists and intellectuals from Leonardo da Vinci to Virginia Woolf, from John Locke to Octavia Butler, have **recorded the ideas they found most interesting in a book they carried around with them, known as a "commonplace book".**

[[Personal knowledge management has a long history]]

> It was a learning tool that the educated class used to understand a rapidly changing world and their place in it.

> > Reading and writing were therefore inseparable activities. They belonged to a continuous effort to make sense of things, for the world was full of signs: you could read your way through it; and by keeping an account of your readings, you made a book of your own, one stamped with your personality.
> > 
> *The Case for Books* [...] Robert Darnton

> Resurrecting the commonplace book allows us to stem the tide, shifting our relationship with information toward the *timeless* and the *private*.

> Instead of consuming ever-greater amounts of content, we could take on a more patient, thoughtful approach that favors rereading, reformulating, and working through the implications of ideas over time.

[[Commonplace books were used to record all the interesting things the author read or thought]]

> Writer and photographer Craig Mod wrote, "There is a gaping opportunity to consolidate our myriad marginalia into an even more robust commonplace book. One searchable, always accessible, easily shared and embedded amongst the digital text we consume."

> More than half the workforce today can be considered "knowledge workers"-- professionals for whom knowledge is their most valuable asset, and who spend a majority of their time managing large amounts of information.

He doesn't seem to provide a source for this.

> For many people, their understanding of notetaking was formed in school. You were probably first told to write something down because it would be on the test. This implied that the minute the test was over, you would never reference those notes again. Learning was treated as essentially disposable, with no intention of that knowledge being useful for the long term.

That could be part of an interesting article title; Disposable Learning: a case for teaching personal knowledge management.

> For modern, professional notetaking, a note is a "knowledge building block"-- a discrete unit of information interpreted through your unique perspective and stored outside your head.

Was it Forte or someone else who wrote about the concept of atomic notes?

> The length and format don't matter-- if a piece of content has been interpreted through your lens, curated according to your taste, translated into your own words, or drawn from your life experience, and stored in a secure place, then it qualifies as a note.

> Your Second Brain becomes like a mirror, teaching you about yourself and reflecting back to you the ideas worth keeping and acting on.

> You can't fail, because failure is just more information, to be captured and used as fuel for your journey.

> **Hebert Simon, an American economic and cognitive psychologist, wrote, "What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention..."**

[[We pay for information with attention]]

> The practice of keeping personal notes also arose in other countries, such as *biji* in China (roughly translated as "notebook"), which could contain anecdotes, quotations, random musings, literary criticisms, short fictional stories, and anything else that a person thought worth recording. In Japan, *zuihitsu* (known as "pillow books") were collections of notebooks used to document a person's life.

> "Marginalia" refers to the marks made in the margins of a book or other document, including scribbles, comments, annotations, critiques, doodles, or illustrations.

> Have you ever lost your smartphone or been unable to access the Internet, and felt like a critical part of yourself was missing? That's a sign that an external tool has become an extension of your mind. In a 2004 study, Angelo Maravita and Atsushi Iriki discovered that when monkeys and humans consistently use a tool to extend their reach, such as using a rake to reach an object, certain neural networks in the brain change their "map" of the body to include the new tool. This fascinating finding reinforces the idea that external tools can and often become a natural extension of our minds.

> Recent advancements and discoveries in the field of "extended cognition" have shed new light on how practical and powerful it can be to "think outside the brain." This book isn't focused on the science, but for an excellent introduction to extended cognition I recommend *The Extended Mind* by Annie Murphy Paul.
### Chapter 3: How a Second Brain Works
>> It is in the power of remembering that the self's ultimate freedom consists. I am free because I remember.
>-- Abhinavagupta, tenth-century Kashmiri philosopher and mystic

> An important tool of the researchers was building physical models [...] They turn vague concepts into tangible entities that can be observed, rearranged, edited, and combined together.

[[Models help us understand things]]

> Deborah Chambers and Daniel Reisberg found in their research on the limits of mental visualization, "The skills we have developed for dealing with the external world go beyond those we have for dealing with the internal world." 

> In its most practical form, creativity is about connecting ideas together, especially ideas that don't seem to be connected.

> Neuroscientists Nancy C. Andreasen [...] "Creative people are better at recognizing relationships, making associations and connections."

> By keeping diverse kinds of material in one place, we facilitate this connectivity and increase the likelihood that we'll notice an unusual association.

> Too often when we take on a task-- planning an event, designing a product, or leading an initiative-- we draw only on the ideas we have access to right in that moment. I call this approach a "heavy lift"--- demanding instantaneous results from our brains without the benefit of a support system.

> Even when we do a brainstorm, that still relies only on the ideas that we can think up right now. [...] This tendency is known as *recency bias*. We tend to favor the ideas, solutions, and influences that occurred to us most recently, regardless of whether they are the best ones.

[[Recency bias is the preference for ideas that we thought of more recently]]

> Having a Second Brain where lots of ideas can be permanently saved for the long term turns the passage of time into your friend, instead of your enemy.

> A recent study from Princeton University found that there is a certain kind of job that is least likely to be automated by machines in coming years. [...] It was jobs that required the ability to convey "not just information but a particular interpretation of information." 
> 
> In other words, the jobs that are most likely to stick around are those that involve promoting or defending a particular perspective.

^e90f17

Knowledge work that argues for or against ideas is not likely to be automated any time soon.

> Advocating for a particular point of view isn't just a matter of sparkling charisma or irresistible charm. It takes supporting material.

> American journalist, author, and filmmaker Sebastian Junger once wrote on the subject of "writer's block": "It's not that I'm blocked. It's that I don't have enough research to write with power and knowledge about that topic. It always means, not that I can't find the right words, [but rather] that I don't have the ammunition."

> If it feels like the well of inspiration has run dry, it's because you need a deeper well full of examples, illustrations, stories, statistics, diagrams, analogies, metaphors, photos, mindmaps, conversation notes, quotes-- anything that will help you argue for your perspective or fight for a cause you believe in.

> Digital notes combine the casual artistry of a daily sketchbook with the scientific power of modern software.

> <buildingasecondbrain.com/resources>

> don't get caught in the trap of perfectionism: insisting that you have to have the "perfect" app with a precise set of features before you take a single note. It's not about having the perfect tools-- it's about having a *reliable* set of tools you can depend on, knowing you can always change them later.

> As people set out on their Second Brain journey, there are three stages of progress I often observe-- and even encourage. Those stages are *remembering*, *connecting*, and *creating*.

> PDFs [...] by importing the findings most relevant to her work into her notes, she can add as many annotations and comments as she wants.

Typing by hand, copy-paste, or exporting from something like Zotero.

> The second way that people use their Second Brain is to connect ideas together. Their Second Brain evolves from being primarily a *memory*tool to becoming a *thinking* tool.

I'm not sure I'm doing much of this yet. Though this might be related to the way I build indices of my notes, and write up topic sentence blurbs.

> Fernando uses his Second Brain to *connect* what he knows from his training and research to the needs of his patients, to be able to treat them more effectively.

> Eventually, the third and final way that people use their Second Brain is for creating new things. They realize that they have a lot of knowledge on a subject and decide to turn it into something concrete and sharable. Seeing so much supporting material ready and waiting gives them the courage to put their own ideas out there and have a positive impact on others.

> To guide you in the process of creating your own Second Brain, **I've developed a simple, intuitive four-part method called "CODE"-- Capture, Organize, Distill, Express.**

> We need to adopt the perspective of a curator, stepping back from the raging river and starting to make intentional decisions about what information we want to fill our minds.

> Like a scientist capturing only the rarest butterflies to take back to the lab, our goal should be to "capture" only the ideas and insights we think are truly noteworthy.

> The solution is to *keep only what resonates* in a trusted place that you control and to leave the rest aside.

> don't worry about why exactly it resonates-- just look inside for a feeling of pleasure, curiosity, wonder, or excitement, and let that be your signal for when it's time to capture a passage, an image, or a fact.

> By training ourselves to notice when something resonates with us, we can improve not only our ability to take better notes, but also our understanding of ourselves and what makes us tick.

> we want to avoid organizing methods that are overly rigid and prescriptive. The best way to organize your notes is to *organize for action*, according to the active projects you are working on right now.

Remembering those phone calls to grandma and grandpa, and how they made me feel. (There is an old couple talking loudly to their kids and grandkids on Zoom at Panera; which made me think of this.)

> Surprisingly, when you focus on taking action, the vast amount of information out there gets radically streamlined and simplified.

> Organizing for action gives you a sense of tremendous clarity, because you know that everything you're keeping actually has a purpose.

> Once you start capturing ideas in a central place and organizing them for action, you'll inevitably begin to notice patterns and connections between them.

[[Organizing by actionability is incredibly useful]]

This is what tends to happen while I read and let my mind wander. But it seems like he's talking about two different things between this and the next bit.

> The human mind is like a sizzling-hot frying pan of associations-- throw a handful of seeds in there and they'll explode into new ideas like popcorn. Every note is the seed of an idea, reminding you of what you already know and already think about a topic.

> *distill your notes down to their essence*

> Every idea has an "essence": the heart and soul of what it is trying to communicate.

> there is always a way to convey the core message in just a sentence or two.

I need to do this more with my notes. One sentence.

> If you've highlighted those takeaways in the flow of the reading you were already doing anyway, you'll be able to remind yourself of what the book contains without having to spend hours rereading it.

> Every time you take a note, ask yourself, "How can I make this as useful as possible for my future self?"

> Think of yourself not just as a *taker* of notes, but as a *giver* of notes-- you are giving your future self the gift of knowledge that is easy to find and understand.

> A common challenge for people who are curious and love to learn is that we can fall into the habit of continuously force-feeding ourselves more and more information, but never actually take the next step and apply it. 

> Information becomes *knowledge*-- personal, embodied, verified--only when we can put it to use. You gain confidence in what you know only when you know that it works. Until you do, it's just a theory.

> I recommend you shift as much of your time and effort as possible from consuming to creating knowledge.

[[It is more valuable to create knowledge than to consume it]]

> All these actions-- evaluate, share, teach, record, post, and lobby-- are synonyms for the act of expression.

I might also add, I often feel like I wouldn't have anything to contribute to the audience. This assumes that they've already read the book or its source material. Change the audience. If it's a cognitive science book, write about it for an audience of teachers or my students. Find places in the world where that knowledge should go. Be a gardener. Transdisciplinary.

[[Change the audience to find fertile new grounds for your ideas]]

> In a wonderful coincidence, recent research by neurophysiologists. May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology indicates that the human brain remembers information using a "grid code"-- a part of the brain involved in spatial reasoning. They speculate that "the grid code could therefore be some sort of metric or coordinate system" that can "uniquely and efficiently represent a lot of information."

> The word "productivity" has the same origin as the Latin verb *producere*, which means "to produce." Which means that at the end of the day, if you can't point to some kind of output or result you've produced, it's questionable whether you've been productive at all.

> The consumerist attitude toward information--that more is better, that we never have enough and that what we already have isn't good enough-- is at the heart of many people's dissatisfaction with how they spend their time online. Instead of trying to find "the best" content, I recommend instead switching your focus to making things, which is far more satisfying.

> Other synonyms for expression include publish, speak, present, perform, produce, write, draw, interpret, critique, or translate.

I wonder if that's why video games are that special kind of addiction and catharsis-- gives me the feeling of creating something while reducing the friction and ultimately I feel dissatisfied because I end up with nothing to show for it.

### Chapter 4: Capture-- Keep What Resonates
> Just as with the food we put into our bodies, it is our responsibility and right to choose our information diet. It's up to us to decide what information is good for us, what we want more of and less of, and ultimately, what we do with it. You are what you consume, and that applies just as much to information as to nutrition.

> A Second Brain gives us a way to filter the information stream and curate only the very best ideas we encounter in a private, trusted place. Think of it as planting your own "knowledge garden" where you are free to cultivate your ideas and develop your own thinking away from the deafening noise of other people's opinions. 

>A garden is only as good as its seeds

> Innovation and impact don't happen by accident or chance. Creativity depends on a *creative process*.

> The challenge for the rest of us is how to apply this same lens to the work we do every day. What kinds of information are worth preserving when we don't know exactly how we'll be putting it it to use?

> A knowledge asset is anything that can be used in the future to solve a problem, save time, illuminate a concept, or learn from past experiences.

Can I use GitHub @ KCC to back up my vault?

> The meaning of a thought, insight, or memory often isn't immediately clear. We need to write them down, revisit them, and view them from a different perspective in order to digest what they mean to us. It is exceedingly difficult to do that within the confines of our heads. We need an external medium in which to see our ideas from another vantage point, and writing things down is the most effective and convenient one ever invented.

> - Is this sensitive information you'd like to keep secure? The content you save in your notes is easily accessible from any device, which is great for accessibility but not for security. Information like tax records, government documents, passwords, and health records shouldn't be saved in your notes.

> it can be hard to know exactly what is worth preserving. I use an insightful exercise to help people make this decisions easier. I call it "Twelve Favorite Problems," inspired by Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman.

> > You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large the will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in awhile there will be a hit, and people will say, "How did he do it? He must be a genius!"

> Feyman's approach was to maintain a list of a dozen open questions ... This cross-disciplinary approach allowed him to make connections across seemingly unrelated subjects, while continuing to follow his sense of curiosity.

[[Cross-disciplinary approaches are linked with higher productivity and creativity]]

> Ask yourself, "What are the questions I've always been interested in?"

> What does it look like to move from mindless consumption to mindful creation?
> How can I go to bed early instead of watching shows after the kids go to bed?

> I recommend asking your family or childhood friends what you were obsessed with as a kid. Those very same interests probably still fire your imagination as an adult.

> the Second Brain Resource Guide at <Buildingasecondbrain.com/resources>

> in any piece of content, *the value is not evenly distributed*

> Don't save entire chapters of a book-- save only select passages.

> You can always save links back to the original content

My 12 questions should be notes and linked from sources.

> it's so important to take on a Curator's Perspective-- that we are the judges, editors, and interpreters of the information we choose to let into our lives.

[[Our main job as a teacher is to be a curator]]

> We know from neuroscientific research that "emotions organize-- rather than disrupt-- rational thinking." When something resonates with us, it is our emotion-based, intuitive mind telling us it is interesting before our logical mind can explain why.

> There's scientific evidence that our intuition knows what it's doing. From the book *Designing for Behavior Change:*

read Designing for Behavior Change #todo/reading 

> "Our intuitive mind learns, and responds, even without our conscious awareness." 
> 
> If you ignore that inner voice of intuition, over time it will slowly quiet down and fade away. If you practice listening to what it is telling you, the inner voice will grow stronger. You'll start to hear it in all kinds of situations. 

Maybe mind is a little overactive.

> It's a good idea to capture key information about the source of a note, such as the original web page address, the title of the piece, the author or publisher, and the date it was published.

```txt
digraph G {
	Obsidian <-- Podcasts
	Obsidian <-- Pocket
	Obsidian <-- Reddit
	Obsidian <-- Remarkable <-- Articles
	Remarkable <-- Books
}
```

> No matter how many different kinds of software you use, don't leave all the knowledge they contain scattered across dozens of places you'll never think to look. Make sure your best findings get routed back to your notes app where you can put them all together and act on them.

[[Avoid keeping notes on multiple platforms]]

> you are much more likely to remember information you've written down in your own words. Known as the "Generation Effect," researchers have found that when people actively generate a series of words, such as by speaking or writing, more parts of their brain are activated when compared to simply reading the same words.

[[More parts of the brain are activated when using information in productive language and sensemaking]]

> Thinking doesn't just produce writing; writing also enriches thinking.

[[Writing improves thinking]]

> One of the most cited psychology papers of the 1990s found that "translating emotional events into words leads to profound social, psychological, and neural changes."

> Perhaps the most immediate benefit of capturing content outside our heads is that we escape what I call the "reactivity loop"--the hamster wheel of urgency, outrage, and sensationalism that characterizes so much of the  Internet.

> What Would This Look Like If It Was Easy?

> MIT economist César Hidalgo in his book *Why Information Grows* describes how physical products, which he calls "crystals of imagination," allow us to turn what we know into concrete objects that other people can access: "Crystallizing our thoughts into tangible and digital objects is what allows us to share our thoughts with others." And elsewhere: "Our ability to crystallize imagination... gives us access to the practical uses of the knowledge and knowhow residing in the nervous systems of other people."

> If you're looking for a more precise answer of how much content to capture in your notes. I recommend no more than 10 percent of the original source, at most. Any more than that, and it will be too difficult to wade through all the material in the future. Conveniently, 10 percent also happens to be the limit that most ebooks allow you to export as highlights.

> This is called "detachment gain," as explained in *The Detachment Gain: The Advantage of Thinking Out Loud* by Daniel Reisberg, and refers to the "functional advantage to putting thoughts into externalized forms" such as speaking or writing, leading to the "possibility of new discoveries that might not have been obtained in any other fashion." If you've ever had to write out a word to remember how it's spelled, you've experienced this.

### Chapter 5
> > Be regular and orderly in your life so that you may be violent and original in your work.
> > 
> -- Gustave Flaubert, French novelist

> in her book *The Creative Habit,* Tharp revealed that a simple organizing technique lies at the heart of a creative process that has propelled her through an incredibly prolific six-decade career.

> "I believe in starting each project with a stated goal. Sometimes the goal is nothing more than a personal mantra such as 'keep it simple' or 'something perfect' or 'economy' to remind me of what I was thinking at the beginning if and when I lose my way."

> the Cathedral Effect. Studies have shown that the environment we find ourselves in powerfully shapes our thinking.

[[Our surroundings play a powerful role in our thinking; known as the Cathedral Effect]]

is this related to why I can get work done better in a coffee shop? ideas and people flow, mingle, etc.

> As knowledge workers we spend many hours every day within digital environments-- our computers, smartphones, and the web. Unless you take control of those virtual spaces and shape them to support the kinds of thinking you want to do, every minute spent there will feel taxing and distracting.

An idea for dnd God-- the Gardener or the Caretaker or the Curator; a triune god?

> You'll start to pay closer attention to the books you read, the conversations you have, and the interviews you listen to, knowing that any interesting idea you encounter can be reliably saved and utilized.

> I eventually named this organizing system PARA, which stands for the four main categories of information our lives: Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives.

[[Forte suggests dividing notes into four categories based on actionability]]

> Instead of requiring tons of time meticulously organizing your digital world, PARA guides you in quickly sorting your ideas according to what really matters: your goals.

> By structuring your notes and files around the completion of your active projects, your knowledge and go to work for you, instead of collecting dust like an "idea graveyard." The promise of PARA is that it changes "getting organized" from a herculean, never-ending endeavor into a straightforward task to get over with so you can move on to more important work.

> 1. Projects: Short-term efforts in your work or life that you're working on now.
> 2. Areas: Long-term responsibilities you want to manage over time.
> 3. Resources: Topics or interest that may be useful in the future.
> 4. Archives: Inactive items from the other three categories.

> they have a beginning and an end; they take place during a outcome that needs to happen in order for them to be checked off as complete, such as "finalize," "green-light," "launch," or "publish."

[[An endeavor that has a specific end date and closure to it is considered a Project.]]

Should my courses be a project or area? I'm starting to think area.

> [Re: Areas] Departments or functions you are responsible for: Account management, Marketing; Operations; Product Development

> People or teams you are responsible for or accountable to: Direct reports; Manager; Board of Directors; Suppliers

> Standards of performance you are responsible for: Professional development; Sales and marketing; Relationships and networking; Recruiting and hiring

> move courses to area, but keep sections in projects

> While there is no goal to reach, there is a *standard* that you want to uphold in each of these areas. For finances, that standard may be that you always pay your bills in time and provide for your family's basic needs. For health, it may be that you exercise a certain number of times per week and keep your cholesterol below a certain number. For family, it may be that you spend quality time with them every evening and on the weekend.

[[An endeavor that has no goal, but a status to maintain, it is considered an Area.]]

> The third category of information that we want to keep is resources.

> What topics are you interested in?
> What subjects are you researching?

People, locations, daily notes go in resources.

> What useful information do you want to be able to reference?
> Which hobbies or passions do you have?

> You can also think of them as "research" or "reference materials." 

> These folders are like the class notebooks you probably kept in school: one for biology, another for history, another for math. 

[[Resources are the reference materials not tied to a specific project or area.]]

> Areas of responsibility that you are no longer committed to maintaining (such as when a relationship ends or after moving out of your apartment) 

[[Archives are items that are no longer active.]]

I think I use a lot of projects that are actually areas.

> the moment you first capture an idea is the worst time to try to decide what it relates to

> it's so important to separate capture and organize into two distinct steps: "keeping what resonates" in the moment is a separate decision from deciding to save something for the long term.

> - Projects are most actionable because you're working on them right now and with a concrete deadline in mind.
> - Areas have a longer time horizon and are less immediately actionable.
> - Resources may become actionable and depending on the situation
> - Archives remain inactive unless they are needed.

> By placing it in a resource folder, you'll notice it only if and when you decide to dive into that topic and do some reading or research.

> The goal of organizing our knowledge is to move our goals forward, not get a PhD in notetaking. Knowledge is best applied through execution, which means whatever doesn't help you make progress on your projects is probably detracting from them.

By this standard.. the COURSE is an area, but the SECTION is a project. This makes sense.

On the method of progressive note-taking, it also serves as a form of spaced repetition re: [[Sims (2022)]]

### Chapter 8: The Art of Creative Execution
- The creative process is a dynamic between divergence and convergence.
- Capture and Organize (CO of CODE) are divergent steps and Distill and Express (DE of CODE) are convergent steps.
- The Archipelago of Ideas is a technique where you start a project by gathering the relevant notes you have captured and organized.
- The Hemmingway Bridge technique is where you leave brief notes at the end of a work session to make it easier to know where to start next session.
- Dial Down the Scope is a technique where you find the easiest deliverable iteration of your project and share it out.

> > Creative products are always shiny and new; the creative process is ancient and unchanging.
> > --Silvano Arieti, psychiatrist and author of *Creativity: The Magic Synthesis*

> This standardized routine is known as the *creative process*, and it operates according to timeless principles that can be found throughout history. 

> **The *products* of creativity are constantly changing** ... But if you go one level deeper, to the *process* of creativity, it is a very different story. **The creative process is ancient and unchanging.**

> **One of the most important patterns that underlies the creative process is called "divergence and convergence."**

> The number of things you are looking at and considering is increasing-- you are diverging from your starting point. 

> You can't fully plan or  organize what you're doing in divergence mode, and you shouldn't try. This is the time to wander. 

> As powerful and necessary as divergence is, if all we ever do is diverge, then we never arrive anywhere.

> Convergence forces us to eliminate options, make trade-offs, and decide what is truly essential. It is about narrowing the range of possibilities so that you can make forward progress and end up with a final result you are proud of.

> If we overlay the four steps of CODE onto the model of divergence and convergence, we arrive at a powerful template for the creative process is our time.
> 
> The first two steps of CODE, Capture and Organize, make up divergence. ... The final two steps, Distill and Express, are about convergence.

> Of the two stages of this process, convergence is where most people struggle. The more imaginative and curious you are, the more diverse your interest, and the higher your standards and commitment to perfection, the more difficult you will likely find it to switch from divergence mode into convergence mode.

> Those actions are tempting because they *feel* like productivity. They feel like forward progress, when in fact they are divergence acts that postpone the moment of completion.

> a quote by Steven Johnson,

>> Instead of confronting a terrifying blank page, I am looking at a document filled with quotes: from letters, from primary sources, from scholarly papers, sometimes even my own notes. It's a great technique for warding off the siren song of procrastination. Before i hit on this approach, I used to lose weeks stalling before each new chapter, because it was just a big empty sea of nothing ness. Now each chapter starts life as a kind of archipelago of inspiring quotes, which makes it seem far less daunting. All I have to do is build bridges between the islands.

> The Archipelago of Ideas technique is a contemporary reinvention of the age-old practice of outlining-- laying out the points you want to include up front, so that when it comes time to execute all you have to do is string them together.

> An Archipelago of Ideas separates the two activities your brain has the most difficulty performing at the same time: *choosing* ideas (known as selection) and *arranging* them into a logical flow (known as sequencing).

> The reason it is so difficult to perform these activities simultaneously is they require different modes: selection is divergent, requiring an open state of mind that is willing to consider any possibility. Sequencing is convergence, requiring a more closed state of mind focused only on the material you already have in front of you.

> the "Hemmingway Bridge." He would always end a writing session only when he knew what came next in the story. Instead of exhausting every last idea and bit of energy, he would stop when the next plot point became clear. This meant that the next time he sat down to work on his story, he knew exactly where to start.

I've also heard this described as "leaving some in the tank," though that might have referred more to leaving motivation and interest for later rather than leaving a trail of ideas to pick up later.

> How do you create a Hemmingway Bridge? Instead of burning through every last ounce of energy at the end of a work session, reserve the last few minutes to write down some of the following kinds of things in your digital notes:
> - Write down ideas for next steps.
> - Write down the current status.
> - Write down any details you have in mind that are likely to be forgotten once you step away.
> - Write out your intention for the next work session.

> I often find that my subconscious mind keeps working in the background to help me improve on those thoughts.

There's a concept in cognitive science about this.. default mode network or something.

> one more thing you can do as you wrap up the day's work: send off your draft or beta proposal for feedback.

> A third technique I recommend for convergence I call "Dial Down the Scope." ... As with so many ambitious goals, once you get into the details it dawns on you just how complex these features are to build. ... The first parts to be dialed down are the ones that are most difficult or expensive to build, that have the most uncertainty or risk, or that aren't central to the purpose of the app.

They do this in software and web design also; alpha and beta tests, rolling updates, Agile development, etc.

> When the full complexity of a project starts to reveal itself, most people choose to delay it. ... The problem isn't a lack of time. It is that we forget we have control over the scope of the project. We can "dial it down" to a more manageable size, and we must if we ever want to see it finished.

> Waiting until you have everything ready before getting started is like sitting in your car and waiting to leave your driveway until all the traffic lights across town are green at the same time.

> One of the best uses for a Second Brain is to collect and save the scraps on the cutting-room floor in case they can be used elsewhere. A slide cut from a presentation could become a social media post. An observation cut from a report could become the basis for a conference presentation.

> Knowing that nothing I write or create truly gets lost--only saved for later use-- gives me the confidence to aggressively cut my creative works down to size without fearing that I've wasted effort or that I'll lose the result of my thinking forever.

 >And sharing before I feel ready has completely altered the trajectory of my career. ... Whatever you are building there is a smaller, simpler version of it that would deliver much of the value in a fraction of the time.

 >- If you want to write a book, you could dial down the scope and write a series of online articles outlining your main ideas. If you don't have time for that, you could dial it down even further and start with a social media post explaining the essence of your message.
 >- If you want to deliver a workshop for paying clients, you could dial it down to a free workshop at a local meetup, or dial it down even further and start with a group exercise of book club for a handful of colleagues or friends.
 >- If you'd like to make a short film, start with a YouTube video, or if that's too intimidating, a livestream. If it's still too much, record a rough cut on your phone and send it to a friend.
 
> This is the chicken-and-egg problem of creativity: you don't know what you should create, but you can't discover what people want until you creative something. Dialing Down the Scope is a way of short-circuiting that paradox and testing the waters with something small and concrete, while still protecting the fragile and tentative edges of your work.

> Divergence and convergence are not a linear path, but a loop: once you complete one round of convergence, you can take what you've learned right back into a new cycle of divergence.

I should try to find easier words for divergence and convergence for L2 students to teach the writing process.

What if I want to write informative readers for emerging bilinguals? I can start with short articles that I write for my own students.

> - Tweetstorm on modern learning
> - Deep background for creating depth behind the subject

> - Are there podcasts by experts you could subscribe to and listen while commuting or doing household chores?

I could listen to more Cognitive Science podcasts. Also, search authors + podcast; Inoue podcasts

> Set a timer for a fixed period of time, such as fifteen or twenty minutes, and in one sitting see if you can complete a first pass on your project *using only the notes you've gathered in front of you*. No searching online, no browsing social media, and no opening multiple browser tabs that you swear you're going to get to eventually. Only work with what you already have. This first pass could be a plan, an agenda, a proposal, a diagram, or some other format that turns your ideas into a tangible artifact.

> Ask yourself, "What is the smallest version of this I can produce to get useful feedback from others?"

> I first learned about the model of divergence and convergence from Design Thinking, an approach to creative problem-solving that emerged out of the Stanford Design School and was further popularized by the innovation consultancy IDEO starting in the 1980s and 1990s.

> One way to think of this is to "end with the beginning in mind," a clever rephrasing of author Stephen Covey's classic advice to "begin with the end in mind."

The same way Backwards Design works in Instructional Design. Not really, though, this is in reference to:
![[Forte (2022)#^43451d]]

and I wouldn't think Covey's intention is equivalent either.
