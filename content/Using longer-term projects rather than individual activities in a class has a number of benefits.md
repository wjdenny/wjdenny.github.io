Using longer-term projects rather than individual activities in a class has a number of benefits. mini-projects instead of "activities" because activities require more planning, and more curriculum/instructor-centered; projects align with more curricular objectives, and are more connected to other learnings in the classroom and other projects (maybe not even just in your classroom)

[[Evan Tobias]] prefers longer-trm projects rather than discrete isolated activities for these reasons.
I feel like this can be applied to a reading/writing class, but I'm not so sure about a speaking/listening class.
