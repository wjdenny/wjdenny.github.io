This is an idea I had for a dissertation or research project while reading [[@1991scovel_effect]]. I want to either read about or design a model to be able to compare the likelihood for a college to fully support linguistic minority students. 

The first challenge would be to define what it would mean for a college to support linguistic minority students. Off the top of my head, I would hope to see relatively equal rates of graduation, relatively equal GPA scores, relatively equal rates of retention, dropping out, and academic dishonesty.

There's certainly more to consider, but that's what I've thought of so far. If there have been efforts at similar models, I should check those out and make sure that linguistic minority students are considered as well as other groups (based on ethnicity, financial need, first-generation student status, etc.)
