## Notes
[[Your resume should show exposure to different types of projects and the diversity of your interests]]
[[Avoid overusing buzzwords on your resume especially without evidence of application]]
[[It helps to provide links to your projects or organizations that you've worked for]]
[[Provide evidence of the quality of your work in a resume]]
[[Have clear objectives of the kind of work you want to do in your resume]]
[[Hiring managers and recruiters should be able to quickly tell where they would want to place you from your resume]]
[[A resume could take up two pages instead of one, but it had better be worth the extra reading]]
[[Coursework is less helpful than projects when writing a resume]]
[[If you have multiple degrees or certifications on your resume, only show the most recent]]
[[Your resume should tell a focused story]]
[[Your resume does not necessarily need to be technical because a recruiter might not be familiar with the jargon]]
[[If possible, show evidence of following through on projects on your resume]]
