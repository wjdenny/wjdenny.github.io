Because [[Excellent UX design can artificially inflate user demand.]], use a bare-bones design to more accurately test business validity. 

An example of this is
> [Maybe](https://maybe.co/), a gorgeous financial services dashboard that [announced a big pivot today](https://twitter.com/Shpigford/status/1645422615279050758) because “six weeks after launch, we only had 50 paying customers, out of a waiting list of 10,000+ people.”

The *aesthetic-usability effect* is the phenomenon where 
> People perceive more aesthetically pleasing interfaces as more intuitive or usable (whether they are or not). User research participants will pick the prettiest option, or tell you they love a beautiful mockup even if it’s difficult or low-value.

*Parkinson's law of triviality* is where 
> People get overwhelmed by big decisions, and so they spend disproportionate time on small ones. User research participants (and designers) love to focus on fun elements like colors and interactions, and don’t get around to the larger questions of why and when the product is needed.
