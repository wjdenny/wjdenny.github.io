She wrote a [[2022 Mesquita|book]] that sounds interesting.

[[Emotions are artifacts of a culture expressed by an individual in a context]]

[[How emotions are defined is different across cultures]]

Emotions are contextual, so the way we interact with in-groups and out-groups can differ. 

Some cultures make a bigger or smaller difference between in and out groups than others.

[I am against my brother, my brother and I are against my cousin, my cousin and I are against the stranger.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedouin#Society) vs. [I look upon the whole world as my fatherland, and every war has to me the horror of a family feud.](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7118786-i-look-upon-the-whole-world-as-my-fatherland)

Even when a person is outside of the culture that formed their emotions, that culture is internalized enough to the point where they do not express differently in a different cultural context.

The view that all emotions are accessible but not expressed in certain cultures is an essentialist view of emotions, and we don't have evidence that this is the case. People who have certain emotions suppressed do not have more of those emotions once outside of the culture that suppresses it.

> Let's say lust or excitement, does that mean that excitement is still in you and that you have to express it more when you're in Vegas? Or does it not mean that, but are there circumstances in which even you can have excitement because you know you you bet your whole your whole um uh life savings in there. And you think you're gonna win and you just had ... Are there circumstances ion which even you can become excited. I believe that, or can you adopt another framework. That's a very different thing than when you know you don't have those very same feelings as what we're used to them something is building up in you which makes it more likely that you have those feelings when you're in a different environment. I'm not contradicting that different environments can elicit very different emotions in people.

[[Emotion is contextual and non-essentialist]] It does not have specific properties that make it what it is.

People who are not that sad but are socializing or seeking pleasant connections with other people do not suffer later on. 

People who in their first interactions after their partner passed where smiling is actually a predictor of doing better later on.

We make meaning with the emotions, but they are not "there" inside us.
[[Emotions emerge in the process of meaning-making and in interactions with other people]]

Not all cultures view emotion as an individual or internal experience.

One's ideal emotional state depends on what you think the main goal in life.
If the main goal is celebrating who you are as an individual, then excitement is more important.
People put in leadership positions choose to be in a excited and positive state of mind.

If your goal is to adjust to circumstances as they arise, then being excited is not ideal.

[[The emotions we favor are determined by what we believe are most functional in our context]]
