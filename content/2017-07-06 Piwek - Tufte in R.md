## Notes
Tufte in R
http://motioninsocial.com/tufte/#minimal-boxplot

> [[Dean Attali]]â€™s ggExtra package includes function ggMarginal to create margin histograms. There is no option to create dot-histograms, just the standard bar-based histograms.

Marginal geometries can be constructed in ggplot2 charts with the ggMarginal package.

> Function geom_tufteboxplot from package ggthemes is used to draw boxplot in ggplot2.

Tufte-style minimal boxplots can be constructed with `geom_tufteboxplot` from ggthemes.
