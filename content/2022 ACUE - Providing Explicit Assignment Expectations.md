One of the most common questions or roadblocks for students is what does the teacher really want? What am I really supposed to be doing here? 

## Casey, Student; The University of Southern Mississippi [00:00:13]
When I'm completing an assignment, I want to perform to the very best ability. But sometimes I feel that I might not know how, if the instructor is not clear in what he or she is expecting. 

## Madison, Student; The University of Southern Mississippi [00:00:23]
It is important to know the purpose of it because as a college student, you can easily feel like an instructor is just giving you busywork, you know, just to get a grade. 

## Mikail, Student; The University of Southern Mississippi [00:00:33]
You don't want to be wasting your time doing an assignment that isn't going to be beneficial to you. You want to make sure that at the end of the day, it's something that you sit down and you're like, I really did learn something that I can use in my future.

So right now, the majority incoming population of college students entering college consists of some combination of ethnically or racially underrepresented students, low-income students, meaning from the bottom socioeconomic income quintile, or first-generation students, students whose, no one in their family has ever gone to college before and they're the first ones to enter college. And for these students, they're at a distinct disadvantage compared with those students who have some experience about what college work ought to look like. There's someone in their family or in their close community that they could talk with about what is college work for, and how do I do it, and what should it look like when it's done. So when we don't show these students up front what we expect, the students who come in with this sort of privileged advantage have a much better chance at succeeding than students who came from some underrepresented group or from an underperforming public high school system. Those students are at a disadvantage. And what transparency tries to do is to help faculty level the playing field so that all students have a fair shot to succeed with their academic work.

Many faculty have given their students an assignment, explain that assignment to them, and there's always at least one student that comes to you and says says, "But exactly what did you want on that assignment?" And you kind of look at them and say, read the assignment. And they're like, "Oh, yeah, yeah, I read the assignment. But exactly what do you want?" Well, that's kind of what a transparent assignment does. 

## Kathy Berlin, PhD [00:02:39]
So one of the assignments for this semester is for you to do a health insurance review. I have put this into a three-page document that provides you with clear steps on how to conduct this assignment. The purpose of this is comparative thinking. In other words, we want you to compare and contrast two different health insurance plans so that you can gain a better understanding of health insurance and what is involved in it. 

## Kathy Berlin, PhD [00:03:11]
So the idea behind this transparency and learning is that you provide students with a clear purpose, the objectives of the assignment, the task that they need to complete in an assignment, the resources that they will need to complete that assignment, the specific steps that they have to take, including question prompts to help them facilitate those steps, and then to talk about how they will be evaluated for the assignment, if there's a rubric that's tied to the assignment. And then what kind of impact would this have on their grade in terms of how is it weighted and how much time should they devote to this assignment? 

## Gregory Eiselein, PhD [00:04:00]
When I read these, here's what I'm going to be looking for. Do you seem to comprehend, understand Dante's style and logic? Do you understand the character? Who is that character, and how have they sinned, and how is their sin going to bring on its own form of punishment? 

## Gregory Eiselein, PhD [00:04:15]
Especially the higher-stakes, higher-order assignments, they're complex. You're asking students to do different kinds of things at the same time. And breaking those out for students is a way of letting them just do a check-off for themselves. Have I thought carefully about the text itself as the place where I'm going to draw evidence? Have I written clearly? Is this organized? Is my tone correct? Am I focused? Those kinds of things. 

## Sarah, Student; Kansas State University [00:04:40]
It requires us to go back through the text and to read it and to kind of just double check our own thinking rather than just writing a paper and hoping that it matches the rubric that he has in mind. 

## Kathy Berlin, PhD [00:04:51]
So there are a couple of benefits to transparent assignments. One, as a student, it gives them a blueprint, a diagram. It gives them a logical sequence that they can follow, that they know if they follow these steps and they take into account the questions that you're asking, then in all probability they're going to submit an assignment for which they'll earn a good grade. At the same time, when I talk to students and they later reflected at the end of the semester, they reflected that following that and thinking about the questions that were asked in during those steps, helped them to really think about what they were being asked to do in a way they had not thought of. 

## Zion, Student; IUPUI [00:05:42]
Being given step-by-step instructions in the transparent assignment really gave me a better understanding of what she was looking for from the assignment and how I could do a better job on the assignment and get a good score. 

## Kelly Lester, MFA; Director, Center for Faculty Development; Professor of Dance; The University of Southern Mississippi [00:06:00]
The first time I used it, I was a little skeptical. Wow, are they going to read all of this? I could look at an assignment from the same assignment . . . I have something that's called the Everyday Movement Observation and I would have probably 50 percent success. But then when I started using transparent guidelines, the submissions were better. They were easier to grade. And so it truly, it made the success rate probably bump up to around 80 percent, and cut down on my grading time, and also set the students up for success. 

## Casey, Student [00:06:34]
So the clear layout of what to do, how to do it, how I'm gonna to be graded, allows me to refer back to those expectations and ensure that I'm doing the best work possible. 

## Kathy Berlin, PhD [00:06:48]
It clearly gives you almost a rubric in and of itself. So you're saying this is what the student needs to do and when you go to grade that assignment, you could say, did they do this? If they met this, they met this. You can tie that into a rubric and make your grading of that assignment very objective versus a subjective analysis of it. At the same time, honestly, let me tell you the number one benefit of a transparent assignment is it minimizes the number of emails and questions that you get from students on how do I do this assignment.

Another element of the transparent assignment in my courses is sharing samples of previous student work. I will generally cull five to six examples of particular assignments that I know students in the past have found challenging and provide my own annotations as read by the rubric for that assignment. So they're able to, before they even submit the assignment for the first time, do kind of their own review of their work and map it into the rubric and the expectations of the assignment.

I like to give students previous students' work with my feedback on it. And then together we can come up with what could this student have done based on the feedback that I offered? They see what is, what are some common errors that other students have done. And then they, it helps them problem solve so that when they get this kind of feedback from me, it'll be more productive. That's the idea. 

## Sophie Adamson, PhD [00:08:35]
I want us to look at the first three sentences with my feedback in the margins. Look at, for example, the sentence, "Tahar Ben Jelloun denounces this well." And you'll see that my feedback says, "Avoid your personal judgment," right? So what would you do if you're the student who receives my feedback? How could you tweak that sentence to take my feedback into consideration? 

## Student; Elon University [00:09:01]
You could say, instead, in L'Ã©cole Perdue, Tahar Ben Jelloun expresses this idea? 

## Sophie Adamson, PhD [00:09:08]
Expresses this idea.  

## Student [00:09:11]
Tahar Ben Jelloun brings to light this issue? 

## Sophie Adamson, PhD [00:09:14]
Excellent. I think both of those give you a good model. 

## Sophie Adamson, PhD [00:09:17]
I think it's important to give a range and not just show the exemplary work, but also show sort of fair work and above-average work so that students can differentiate between the different skills and expectations. What I like to do as well when I show a range of different work is to say, you know, why is this fair and not good? And what could we do to strengthen this piece? I think it really helps students to see the variety that exists and to hear my expectations. 

## Zoe, Student; Elon University [00:09:53]
It definitely helps me to then go back and revise my own work by sort of seeing what the professor highlighted where. 

## RomÃ¡n, Student; California State University, Northridge [00:10:01]
I definitely think it's beneficial to see work that is quality and work that needs to be improved because sometimes you as the student don't know what specifically, what it means toâ Like when you need to be better. Sometimes you just don't know exactly the format of what it needs to look like, like a specific annotated bibliography or, or a specific project. And it's nice to see, you know, past work so you can be firstly inspired and then you know exactly what she's looking for. 

## Nicole Blalock, PhD [00:10:34]
I find that providing students with very transparent assignments, having the rubric, having the student examples, all of these are pieces that go into me being able to have classrooms with higher expectations for students because they see exactly what it is that they're expected to do, to engage with. And they aren't left to just kind of guess what's happening. We're able to really align how they're engaging with content with a lot of very practical academic skills.
