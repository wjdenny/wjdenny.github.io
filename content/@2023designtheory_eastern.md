## Rhetorical PrÃ©cis
Design Theory, in their YouTube video titled "Eastern & Western Design: How Culture Rewires the Brain", argues that fundamental differences in the way different cultural groups think influences design patterns. He supports this claim with a comparative history of European and eastern Asian philosophy and several examples of cultural differences expressed through design choices. Design Theory's purpose is to encourage people to be open minded and think about how people from other cultures might perceive things differently. He adopts a conversational tone for the viewers of their channel and others interested in the topic of cross-cultural communication and design.
## Notes
European culture diverged more widely from others due to a few key factors.
- Greek notions of individuality and concept of nature in opposition to humans.
- incest taboos (church banned cousin marriage)
- Protestant reformation made spirituality a personal venture rather than church or state; but this seems more like something that would come from an underlying cultural value of analytical thinking.

Confucianist values called on people to align their personal interests with those of their community and to keep the harmony. This seems related to the Muslim/Arabic concept of *eib* and *kalam il-nas* [Guapa]. Confucianism is a system of ethics moreso than a religion. These "collectivist" cultures don't preclude the concept of an individual, but the individual seeks status by what they provide for their community.

> [18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UAsN9wvePE&t=18m55s) Your life, your thoughts, and your deeds are never just yours. They're part of an interconnected reality. It's not about individual liberty, it's about collective harmony.

There are echoes of this in "Western" thought as well which is why citation is so important in academic work. Citation both values the individual effort in earlier work, but also acknowledges the dependence of current work on that previous work.

Another point he makes is about the level of collectivism and individuality can be influenced by environmental factors. Crop production that relies on communal labor is more likely to lead to collectivist cultures. Environments that have many different kinds of people living among each other (like major cities) tend to be more individualistic. I can see this playing out in the United States and differences between major cities and in rural areas, but I'm not sure how well it explains places like the Persian Gulf and Levant. Those are mountainous areas with many different types of people; i.e., all along the Silk Road. Yet those are cultures considered to be collectivist by our standards. We need a better way to study and measure this.

He also points to the [[Sapir-Whorf hypothesis]] and how language can change the way we think; but the [[Sapir-Whorf hypothesis]] received a lot of criticism from what I remember in grad school. He also cites examples of language and color perception. 

> Western models like SWAT or even design methodologies that emphasize clear goals and personas often sacrifice nuance for the sake of clarity. [30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UAsN9wvePE&t30m19s) 

Something like a mind map is an example he gives of a tool rooted in more holistic thinking. Interconnected notes like Obsidian or a Zettelkasten would also be examples of this. [[@2022forte_second]] (or was it one of the many YouTube videos on note-taking). It seems like a holistic approach is more natural; it's the way nature works and the way our brains work. There is a learned tendency to divide the world into a system of classifications, though. Sometimes a simple dichotomy (like gender in most cultures), sometime a complex taxonomy such as species.

[[@2020anthonysdesk_mocs]] describes competing processes of divergence, emergence, and convergence of notes. This seems analogous to a "Western" tendency to know through divergence and an "Eastern" tendency to know through emergence. See also: [[Irreducible notes promote development of thought networks]]

An example of lost nuance: [[A language is a dialect with an army and a navy.]]

> Maybe a variety of ideas can enrich a design rather than muddle it. Take a cue from Kaiping Peng's research which found that east Asians often perceive both positive and negative emotions in the same exact facial expression. Now, apply this to design: imagine a design that invites contradictory feelings; calmness and excitement, nostalgia and futurism; all at once.

I wonder if its possible to draw links between development of thes Western cultural ideals and #capitalism
