# Update Your Course Syllabus for chatGPT
[[Ryan Watkins]] wrote this article for [[Medium]].

> [!summary] Summary
> ChatGPT has potential uses and benefits for students and instructors.

## Notes
>1. Clarify your objectives.
> 
> Before updating anything, be clear on what learners should know and be able to do at the end of the course, and why you want them to know and be able to do those things. This will guide you in determining exactly what knowledge and skills (i.e., value) students will gain from the class, and how you can assess their learning.

You can mitigate disruption from AI tools by making learning objectives more clear to students.

>2. Expand your options.
> 
> It is time to expand your repertoire of instructional strategies. Atsusi Hirumi offers a handy guide to research-grounded strategies for any classroom. These are not, however, “a la carte” menus; you must use all of the steps of any strategy to gain the evidence-based benefits.

Use a wider variety of teaching techniques (i.e., less focus on product and more on process)

>1. Include time for ethics.
>
>Add time into your course to discuss the ethical implications of chatGPT and forthcoming AI systems. Talk with students about the ethics of using chatGPT in your course, at your university, and within your discipline or profession. Don’t be afraid to discuss the gray areas where we do not yet have clear guidance or answers.

You can mitigate disruption from AI tools by talking with students about the ethics of using AI and the value of human instruction.

> 5. Remember, chatGPT is not human.
> 
> Be careful not to anthropomorphize chatGPT. ChatGPT is a language model and if we anthropomorphize these technologies then it will be much harder to understand their promise and perils. Murray Shanahan suggests that we avoid statements such as, “chatGPT knows…”, or “ChatGPT thinks…”; instead, use “According to chatGPT…” or “ChatGPT’s output…”.

Avoid anthropomorphizing AI tools like chatGPT to put the output into perspective.

> a. Identify a major question or challenge in your field or discipline that chatGPT could write about. Preferably a question with no clear single right answer.
> 
> b. Have students collaborate (in pairs or small teams) on developing 5 to 10 criteria for assessing chatGPT responses to the major question. For example, chatGPT’s output references more than one theoretical perspective.
> 
> c. Ask students to individually write a prompt for chatGPT to answer the major question.
> 
> d. Have students use their criteria to judge the responses of other students (in the pair or small team), and rate the chatGPT prompts/responses from best to worst.

Instructional activities can use both chatGPT and students own knowledge and skill.

> a. Ask students to individually identify a major question or challenge in your field or discipline that chatGPT could write about.
>
> b. Have students use chatGPT to write a response to their question or challenge.
> 
> c. Ask students to reflect on chatGPT’s output (e.g., what is correct, incorrect, what they don’t know if it is correct or incorrect, what should they look up elsewhere to verify, what should they ask chatGPT next).
> 
> d. Using _Track Changes_ in MS Word or _Suggesting_ in Google Docs, have students improve the output of chatGPT (e.g., correcting errors or misinformation, expanding on shallow content).
> 
> e. Have students submit their prompt and the improved chatGPT response with their added content highlighted.
>
> c. George Heard is attributed with saying “The true meaning of the word revision is this: to see again.” Have students revise (write again) chatGPT’s output from a different [angle]. For instance, take a different perspective, apply a critical lens, expand on a particular concept, or correct aspects of the output that could cause their peers to misunderstand or misinterpret.

> b. For those who choose to use chatGPT, they have to submit their prompt(s) and the chatGPT output. Using _Track Changes_ in MS Word or _Suggesting_ in Google Docs, have students add depth, clarify misinformation, offer alternative perspectives, and make other improvements to the chatGPT output.

> a. Since chatGPT can’t natively make visual representations of content (see note below), have students create mind maps (aka, associative maps, spider map, process maps) to illustrate the connections between ideas, concepts, approaches, or theories in your field or discipline.

> b. The more details or levels that students add to their mind minds, the easier it will be for them to demonstrate their newly acquired knowledge and skills.
