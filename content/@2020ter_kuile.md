## Notes

### Preface
Check out [[The Science of Happiness podcast]] from [[Dacher Keltner]].
I need to focus on finding more community this year. What kinds of people should I seek out? What makes for a balanced community? Or does it not have any parallels with a D&D party? [p. x]

Can I just walk into a church and reflect quietly? ***REMOVED*** seems to think so. [p. xii-xiii]

### Introduction
The book is about applying meaning to everyday events; making the mundane sacred. [p. 4]

Check out the paper *How we gather*; [[Casper ter Kuile]] is one of the authors. [p. 5]

Community matters; examples of non-religious organizations with strong communities includes CrossFit, Tough Mudder, Artisan's Asylum, Soul Cycle, etc. [p. 7-10].

I wonder what Iowa City CrossFit gets into; socially or politically.

One of the things they do in CrossFit is connect inspirational figures to the workouts they do [p. 8]. I bet I could do something similar; work myself up over past anarchist leaders or something.

This subject matters because we are more lonely and isolated than ever before [p. 11]

Check out a 2006 Annual Sociological Review paper; the number of people we feel like we can talk to in hard times went from an average of 2.94 people in 1985 to 2.08 in 2004 [p 12]. I wonder what it is now.

[[Community care is just as important as self-care]] [p. 13]

[[People tend to respond with self-preservation when they feel isolated]]
ter Kuile calls it the "doom spiral" and [[Brenè Brown]] in *Braving the Wilderness* writes about it.

ter Kuile quoted a 2006 General Social Survey saying that 26% of Americans were not religious [p. 16].

- [ ] check out *Choosing Our Religion* by Drescher
[p. 18]

> In her book choosing our religion [[Elizabeth Drescher]] explains that we nones [people who choose "none" as their religion on surveys] see our spiritual lives as organic and emerging, responding to the people around us rather than structured into dogmatic categories of belief and identity. Said otherwise, we're less likely to affiliate with an institution than we are to affiliate with another individual. We see religious institutions as being driven by hypocrisy and greed, judgmentalism and sexual abuse, anti-scientific ignorance and homophobia. People also leave religious communities behind because worship experiences are simply boring or formulaic. Most interesting to me is that we are especially wary of a religious identity that threatens to "overwrite [our] self-identity in ways that seem to compromise personal integrity and authenticity," as dresser writes. [p. 18]

[[Religion is institutionalized spirituality, and not spirituality itself]]

> Activist and minister [[Kathleen McTigue]], who looks for three things in any practice or ritual: intention, attention, and repetition. So, though you may take the dog out for a walk numerous times a day, ticking off the repetition component, it isn't a ritual practice if you're also on the phone because you're not really paying attention to your pup and the walk you're on. [p. 25--26]

[[McTigue identified three aspects of any spiritual practice; intention, attention, and repetition]]

[[My own personal rituals]]

> Quaker activist and teacher [[Parker Palmer]] calls it rejoining our soul and our role because in the splitting of the two, much of our loss awareness and subsequent suffering appears. P 32

> Writer [[Marilynne Robinson]] phrases it like this: "the classic soul is more ourselves than we are, a loving and well loved companion, loyal to us uniquely, and trusted to us, to whom we entrust ourselves. We feel it's yearnings, it's musings, as a truer and more primary experience of ourselves than our ordinary consciousness can offer us." [p. 33--34]

[[Spiritual practices strengthen our connection to our higher self]]

I've met this guy (higher self). And I think this is what [[Khalil Gibran]] refers to when he uses the word beloved. Because it's often this person, this spirit, this energy, that I feel in a person who I dream about dating or being with, or a child I'm protecting. Same with the "Jesus" character that I dreamt of when I was younger. That's me. Higher self, inner self, true self, whatever you want to call it. 

> Yet I offer a bold rebuttal: none of these definitions is what makes a text sacred. It isn't about the author or the inspiration. As my mentor, Harvard Don't School professor Stephanie Paulsell, explains, a text is sacred *when a community says that the text is sacred.* It's that simple. When a group of people returns year in, year out, to the same text, wrestling with it by investigating their questions, struggles, and joys--that's what does it. [p. 40]

[[Community makes reading sacred]]

> In everyday language, we think of "sacred" as an adjective, as a synonym for "holy" or "blessed." It describes something static maybe, a little dusty, outside our day-to-day experience. But it is much better understood as a verb--something that we *do*. The word "sacred" itself comes from the Latin *sacrare*, which means to consecrate or dedicate. And to consecrate means to declare or *make* something holy. So the sacredness is in the doing, and that means we have enormous agency to make "sacred" happen ourselves. [p. 40]

> If this seems far-fetched, it's because we live under the lasting influence of the great French sociologist Emile Durkheim, who made the distinction between the sacred and the profane. [p. 40--41]

> We'd use spiritual practices from antiquity, like [[PaRDeS]] and [[Florilegia]], to dig underneath the plot and find unexpected wisdom in the wizarding world. [p. 43]

> We launched *Harry Potter and the sacred text* as a podcast in May 2016. 

> [[Keith Oatley]], a cognitive psychologist at the [[University of Toronto]], made headlines in 2006 with a study that suggested reading about other people improves our ability to understand and cooperate with others and ultimately to understand ourselves. [p. 45--46]

> In a German study from 2017, participants were taught to recognize different subpersonalities, such as our "happy voice" or "inner critic." By learning to engage critically with our own various thought patterns, we become better able to infer the mental states of others. [p. 45--46]

> > Someone very close to me pointed out many times that if I didn't see someone from an oppressed or underprivileged group in light of what they had to do with to get where they are, then I didn't really see them at all. [p. 49]

> In the 12th century,[[ Guigo II]] wrote a little book-- it's more of a pamphlet really--explaining exactly how to do it [lectio divina]. He called the book *Scala Claustralium*, which translates from the Latin into *The Ladder of Monks*. In it, he describes how to read a text and four steps moving up a ladder, climbing ever closer to heaven. [p. 50]

> Rather than reading entire chapters in the Bible, [[Guigo II|Guigo]] instructed his students to choose just a sliver of text to chew on. [...] A century earlier, [[Saint Anselm]] had advised his wealthy patron, countess [[Matilda of Tuscany]], that if she read a sacred text her goal was not to finish reading it, but instead to read only as much as would stir her mind to prayer. Medieval scholar [[Duncan Robertson]] explains that "the fulfillment of reading [began] in the moment the reader [lifted] her eyes from the page and [took] and active part in what [was] now with dialogue." [p. 50--51]

While it seems a little similar to how I'm reading for Zettelkasten and atomic notes, I think there's a sort of greed to my way of doing it. As if the goal is to amass and weaponize knowledge rather than gain wisdom. Is that really the case though?

> Guigo ... names these as reading, meditating, praying, and contemplating. The way Vanessa and I have translated this on the Harry Potter and the sacred text podcast is to think of these four stages as four sets of questions.
> 
> 1. What's literally happening in the narrative? Where are we in the story?
> 2. What allegorical images, stories, songs, or metaphors show up for you?
> 3. What experiences have you had in your own life that come to mind? 
> 4. What action are you being called to take? [p. 51--52]

[[There are many names for traditions of mindful reading across cultures]]

> Of course, Guigo is only one teacher of sacred reading. On a podcast, we've learned from saint Ignatius's teaching of sacred imagination--The practice of placing ourselves into the story read as a character in the text - in order to better engage with the reading. Saint Ignatius's concept of sacred imagination also invites us to notice all of our senses - what we hear, see, touch, smell, and taste. [p. 57]

> Of course, Christians aren't the only ones with sacred reading practices: Jewish communities have long engaged in havruta , a traditional rabbinic approach to tell mood of study in which a pair of students analyzes and discusses a shared text. Often, this is done by asking one another question gleans from the pages of the text. For example, in Harry Potter, why do owls appear at times of transition in the story? In this practice, it isn't enough to just ask a question of your learning partner - you must also propose a potential answer.  [p. 57--58]

Are Tibetan koans similar?

> Numerous teachers have started to adapt *lecto divina* for the classroom, treating four-part homework assignments or conversation prompts for their students. Others led sacred imagination with core curriculum texts. [p. 58]

[[Sacred reading does not need to be only text.]]

> Dutch theologian Henri Nouwen wrote an entire book focus on the sacred reading of a single Rembrandt painting. [p. 60]

Notice what I'm doing, I tend to record the evidence in a text that I'm reading but I don't focus as much on the actual point. I think I'm trying to avoid putting the point without putting in the evidence so I think I want both.
Maybe that's not so bad, with the evidence recorded I can form my own facts around that and come to possibly a different fact or combine it with other evidence that I reported from other sources to create a deeper fact.

> A 2014 study looked at seventh-day Adventists, a Christian group, who are known for strict Sabbath observance and demonstrated a significantly between Sabbath keeping and mental and physical health. [p. 65]

> Researchers have established that there are fewer adult deaths in Israel on Shabbat. [p. 65]

> Through our research of case studies for *How We Gather*, we found that in our modern lives, Sabbath can be applied especially usefully in three ways: Tech sabbath, sabbath for solo time, and sabbath for playing creativity. [p. 65]

> As artist [[Jenny Odell]] writes in her fabulous book *How to do Nothing*, nothing is harder to do these days than doing nothing. [p. 67]

> Herschel published book in 1951 ... Already he knew how best we should engage in modern technology. "The solution to mankind's most vexing problems will not be found in renouncing technical civilization, but in attaining some degree of independence from it." [p. 67]

> Technologist [[Kevin Kelly]] explains that it takes every new technology a decade before society comes to consensus on what etiquette we need to tame it. For the sample, it was 10 years after the cell phone was invented that the manufacturers introduced the option of a silent, or vibrate, mode. [p. 68]

> Study led by [[Sarah Konrath]] at [[Indiana University]] concluded that those who struggled to identify and process their emotions use social media more often than those who are in touch with their feelings. [p. 69]

> [[Heschel]] writes, "We must not forget that it is not a thing that lends significance to a moment; but it is the moment that lends significance to things." [p. 71]

> Sabbath isn't a time to catch up on tasks. Nor is it simply a time of rest to prepare for a busy week. It is a time to revel in the beauty and delight of simply being. The Sabbath "is not for the purpose of recovering one's lost strength and becoming fit for the forthcoming labor," [[Heschel]] writes. "The Sabbath is a day for the sake of life ... The Sabbath is not for the sake of the weekdays; the weekdays are for the sake of the Sabbath." [p. 72]
