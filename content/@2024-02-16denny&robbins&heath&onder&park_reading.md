## Chapter 9: [[@2017demüeller_digital|Digital Dreams: The Rhetorical Power of Online Resources for DREAM Act Activists]]

- García de Müeller advocates students using education as ways to combat discrimination and develop ethnic communities (p. 131). How can faculty assist this development? With recent moves against critical race theory and DEI initiatives, what levels of institutional power might allow faculty the freedom to continue this line of work?
- García de Müeller identifies the “guide” genre as being problematic in its tendency to lead students toward assimilation and adopting tools of the dominant power (p. 138). How do our curricula enforce or break this dynamic?
- García de Müeller, citing Sohan, discusses the interplay between student agency in how they use language (what may be a more nuanced and empowering version of the idea of “interlanguage”) and what instructional staff see as errors (pp. 139–140). How would you define different types of error in your classroom? In what ways can faculty develop the “re-localized listening” skills suggested by Sohan?


adding cultural responsive .. instructional design
including holidays, cultural responsive 

different literacy backgrounds; making a more well-rounded course to have something that appeals to many backgrounds.-- research shows that this fosters more connections with students; compare with user experience design in marketing

diversity in types of assignments; i.e., recordings instead of live presentation

UDL = universal design for learning; cast.org




## Chapter 10: [[@2017choudhury_begali|Bengali-Speaking Multilingual Writers in Transition into Community College]]

- Choudhury & Garrison-Fletcher remind readers that linguistic minority students are not a “monolithic group with a homogeneous educational experience,” (p. 144) though this is a common assumption in course and intervention design across the college. What strategies can be used to shift the college towards a more asset-based mindset regarding cultural and language diversity?
- Choudhury & Garrison-Fletcher cite Cummins on the transfer of academic skills from students’ first language (L1) to their acquired languages given the opportunity to use both in the classroom (pp. 144–145). A common attitude towards L1 use in the class among students from more traditional schooling contexts is that they must use their L1 as little as possible in order to learn another language. While we may recognize this as learned behavior from previous English-learning experiences, what can we do to encourage students to resist deficit-based attitudes towards their home languages?

Richard: sharing research about why we make our pedagogical choices might be beneficial

## Chapter 11: [[@2017kiernan_immigrant|Immigrant Mosaics: Advancing Multilingual Education in Canadian Postsecondary Settings]]

- While support for multiculturalism and multilingualism may be lacking at the policy/macro level in the U.S. compared to Canada, what national, state, or institutional policies can we leverage to support the development of language and cultural diversity in our communities?

technical definitions and commonly confused concepts, providing them up front in a lecture; research shoes can be very helpful to LM students.

## Chapter 12: [[@2017wojahn_first]]

- In the statistics reported by Wojahn et al., the the reported levels of access to technology for their education had a wider variability for students who did not pass the class and for students whose first language was not English, though they reported no statistical difference in the levels reported. What technology-related issues have you noticed in your classrooms, and (if applicable) did they seem to have a pattern of difference between English native and non-native speakers?
