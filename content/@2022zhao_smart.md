## Notes

The Illusion of Competence is the reason why we often can't remember what we just read or learned. Our note-taking or study methods can make us feel like we have learned something when we haven't.

Smart notes
- are *active*,
- are atomic, and
- are connected.

Active means not passive highlighting or underlining, but actively connecting the new information to your existing world.

One method is known as QEC. Identify the question, evidence, and conclusion in things that you read. This would be a good idea to include in all of my source summaries. The QEC concept was coined and developed by [[Cal Newport]].

For example:
Question: Why is it so hard to remember what I just read?
Evidence: ... no, that's not right. Illusion of Competence isn't evidence; it's an explanation.

Atomic notes are similar to Zettlekasten. Giant documents structure our thinking vertically, but atomic ideas can be interconnected in different ways.

[[Charlie Munger]] said: 
> The first rule is that you can't really know anything if you just remember isolated facts and try to bang 'em back.
> 
> If the facts don't hang together on a latticework of theory, you don't have them in a usable form.

Zhao is suggesting to have each Q, E, and C in it's own atomic note.

The Compass of Zettlekasten thinking

For each idea; think in four directions.
North: Where does this idea come from?
West: What's similar to this idea?
East: What competes with this idea?
South: Where can this idea link to next?

> You do not rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems.
