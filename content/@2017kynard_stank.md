This was published in [Teacher-Scholar-Activist](https://teacher-scholar-activist.org) which seems like an interesting source for more reading material.

> Kynard was asked to modify her syllabus to accommodate white feelings at the expense of her black and brown students.

## Notes
> Daily moments like this remind you of the white-policing function of language in the academy.  It should come as no surprise that a white administration would respond so swiftly to my attempt at interrupting the reproduction of white language, affect, and power. The bodies of racialized students and faculty in these settings must be managed away from their proclivity to express themselves in alternative means and from alternative cultural and political legacies. Within such colonizing norms, I am expected to teach students to compose themselves by containing and restraining what [Janine Young Kim](http://lawreview.colorado.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/9.-87.2-Kim_Final.pdf) calls racial emotions, namely grief, anger, fear, hatred, and disgust.

[[Academic language is a product of white colonial norms and similarly tries to avoid racial emotions]]

> Whiteness, purity, and cleanliness have an undeniable linguistic genealogy in the United States (as well as a material reality given the money that the producers of Ivory soap made) undergirding what Dana Berthold calls “the formation of a dominant subjectivity which…is coded white” (p. 13).

[[Whiteness is a code that is associated with cleanliness, neatness, and purity]]
