## Rhetorical Précis
Dr. Pacheco-Vega, in his blog article titled "Triaging your reading workload" (2019), argues that the ways in which we decide when to read an article in more depth can and should vary by individuals and is best learned by experience. He supports this suggestion by providing examples of techniques that work for him but others have claimed are not effective as well as vice versa and finally encouraging readers to develop their own guidelines for deciding what merits further reading. Pachecho-Vega's purpose is to show how to more effectively process reading workloads in order to help students and researchers make better decisions about what to read in more depth. He adopts an informal tone for the readers of his blog and others interested in the topic of knowledge management. 

## Notes

> Developing reading strategies takes time and is something that can only be improved with experience.
> 
> You get better at reading (and writing) by **reading AND writing.**
> 
> So my recommendation, always, is _“try something, see if it works, if it doesn’t, change it and try again”._


> Another heuristic I use to decide whether I will read something in more depth is the **number, density and relevance of comments I make on a paper**.
