## Notes
> Second language researchers and theorists have long been aware that anxiety is often associated with language learning. Teachers and students generally feel strongly that anxiety is a major obstacle to be overcome in learning to speak another language, and several recent approaches to foreign language teaching, such as community language learning and suggestopedia, are explicitly directed at reducing learner anxiety. p. 28

[[Anxiety is a major obstacle to learning a foreign language]]

> Guiora (1983) argues that language learning itself is "a profoundly unsettling psychological proposition" because it directly threatens an individual's self-concept and worldview.

[[Language learning destabilizes one's worldview and sense of self]]

This should be even more true for ESL students who came to be in this situation under duress; including some students who used to be doctors in their home countries now working in a factory taking community college classes.

> In [[@1991scovel_effect|his 1978 (this volume) review of research]], Scovel argues that scholars have been unable to establish a clear-cut relationship between anxiety and overall foreign language achievement; he attributes the discrepant findings at least in part to the inconsistency of anxiety measures used and concludes: "It is perhaps premature to relate it [anxiety] to the global and comprehensive task of language acquisition."

[[Evidence of the affect that anxiety has on language learning is mixed]]

> These studies indicate that anxiety can affect the communication strategies students employ in language class. That is, the more anxious student tends to avoid attempting difficult or personal messages in the target language. 

[[Anxiety changes how students attempt to interact in the language]]

> Anxious learners also complain of difficulties discriminating the sounds and structures of a target language message. One male student claims to hear only a loud buzz whenever his teacher speaks the foreign language. Anxious students may also have difficulty grasping the content of a target language message. Many LSC [Learning Skills Center] clients claim that they have little or no idea of what the teacher is saying in extended target language utterances.

[[Anxiety changes how students perceive the language]]

This might also explain others' intolerance to foreign languages.

> The problem can also be isolated in persistent "careless" errors in spelling or syntax. The student realizes, usually some time after the test, that he or she knew the correct answer but put down the wrong one due to nervousness. If the student realizes he or she is making preventable errors during the test, anxiety-- and errors-- may escalate. [p. 29]

[[Anxiety can result in careless errors during language production]]

> Overstudying is a related phenomenon. Students who are overly concerned about their performance may become so anxious when they make errors, they may attempt to compensate by studying even more. Their frustration is understandable when their compulsive effort does not lead to improved grades. One bright woman who had lived in Mexico spent eight hours a day preparing for a beginning Spanish class-- and still did poorly. The reverse behavior is also possible. Anxious students may avoid studying and in some cases skip class entirely in an effort to alleviate their anxiety [p. 29]

[[Anxiety can change students' study habits]]

> Certain beliefs about language learning also contribute to the students' tension and frustration in the classroom. We note that a number of students believe nothing should be said in the foreign language until it can be said correctly and that it is not okay to guess an unknown foreign language word (Horwitz, 1984).

[[Anxiety changes how students attempt to interact in the language]]

I've definitely heard students say this.

> Savignon (1972) stresses the vital role of spontaneous conversational interactions in the development of communicative competence, while Krashen (1980) argues that the extraction of meaning from second language messages ... is the primary process in the development of a second language. Anxiety contributes to an affective filter, according to Krashen, which makes the individual unperceptive to language input; thus, the learner fails to "tale in" the available target language messages and language acquisition does not progress [p. 30]

[[Anxiety changes how students attempt to interact in the language]]

> Because foreign language anxiety concerns performance evaluation within an academic and social context, it is useful to draw parallels between it and three related performance anxieties: (1) communication apprehension; (2) test anxiety; and (3) fear of negative evaluation.

Language anxiety is not the same thing as communication apprehension.

> Communication apprehension is a type of shyness characterized by fear of or anxiety about communicating with people. Difficulty in speaking in dyads or groups (oral communication anxiety) or in public ("stage fright"), or in listening to or learning a spoken message (receiver anxiety) are all manifestations of communication apprehension. 

> People who have trouble speaking in groups are likely to experience even greater difficulty speaking in a foreign language class where they have little control of the communicative situation and their performance is constantly monitored. p. 30

I think it actually has the opposite affect for me, at least in low proficiency levels. If I cannot monitor myself, I have no idea how bad I am. (see next quote)

> Ordinarily self-conscious and inhibited speakers may find that communicating in a foreign language makes them feel as if someone else is speaking and they therefore feel less anxious. This phenomenon may be similar to stutterers who are sometimes able to enunciate normally when singing or acting. [page 30]

Second language speaking sometimes lessens anxiety -- suggestopedia

> Since performance evaluation is an ongoing feature of most foreign language classes, test anxiety is also relevant to a discussion of foreign language anxiety. Test anxiety refers to a type of performance anxiety stemming from a fear of failure (Gordon & Sarason, 1955; Sarason, 1980). Test-anxious students often put unrealistic demands on themselves and feel that anything less than a perfect test performance is a failure. Students who are test-anxious in foreign language calss probably experience considerable difficulty since tests and quizzes are frequent and even the brightest and most prepared students often make errors. Oral tests have the potential of provoking both test and oral communication anxiety simultaneously in susceptible students. [page 30]

citations for test anxiety
Foreign language communication anxiety can overlap with test anxiety.

> Fear of negative evaluation, defined as "apprehension about others' evaluations, avoidance of evaluative situations, and the expectation that others would evaluate oneself negatively," is a third anxiety related to foreign language learning (Watson & Friend, 1969) ... Unique among academic subject matters, foreign languages require continual evaluation by the only fluent speaker in the class, the teacher. [page 31]

fear of negative evaluation -- can't avoid this in college; maybe having additional native speakers evaluating would help?

> Although communication apprehension, test anxiety, and fear of negative evaluation provide useful conceptual building blocks for a description of foreign language anxiety, we propose that foreign language anxiety is not simply the combination of these fears transferred to foreign language learning. Rather, we conceive foreign language anxiety as a distinct complex of self-perceptions, beliefs, feelings, and behaviors related to classroom language learning arising form the uniqueness of the language learning process. [page 31]

Language anxiety is not a single construct but a complex

> Adults typically perceive themselves as reasonably intelligent, socially adept individuals, sensitive to different sociocultural mores. These assumptions are rarely challenged when communicating in a native language as it is usually not difficult to understand others or to make oneself understood. However, the situation when learning a foreign language stands in marked contrast. Because individual communication attempts will be evaluated according to uncertain or even unknown linguistic and sociocultural standards, second language communication entails risk taking and is necessarily problematic. Because complex and nonspontaneous mental operations are required in order to communicate at all, any performance in the L2 is likely to challenge an individual's self-concept as a competent communicator and lead to reticence, self-consciousness, fear, or even panic. [page 31]

self-perception and limts of expression cause anxiety

> The experiences related in the support groups contreibuted to the development of the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale (FLCAS) (Horwitz, 1983).

> The fact that anxious students fear they will not understand *all* language input is also consistent with communication apprehension. Students endorse statements like "it frightens me when I don't understand what the teacher is saying in the foreign language" (35%); "I get nervous when I don't understand every word the teacher says (27%)". They believe that in order to have any chance of comprehending the target language message they must understand every word that is spoken. [page 34]

Anxious students feel they won't understand all input.

> Anxious students are afraid to make mistakes in the foreign language. They endorse the statement "I am afraid that my language teacher is ready to correct every mistake I make" (15%), while disagreeing with "I don't worry about making mistakes in the language class" (65%). These students seem to feel constantly tested and to perceive every correction as a failure. [page 34]

> Specific techniques which teachers may use to allay students' anxiety include relaxation exercises, advice on effective language learning strategies, behavioral contracting, and journal keeping [3]. [page 35]
>
> [3] See McCoy (1979) for a discussion of dealing with student anxieties in the foreign language classroom .Techniques for teaching relaxation are included in Benson (1973) and Jacobson (1938). Behavioral contracting is an anxiety reduction method for students having difficulty attending to the learning task. The student agrees to spend a specific amount of time on a task, such as going to the language lab, and then reports back to the teacher on her or his success. [page 36]

Behavioral contracting might be similar to labor-based grading contracts.

> But language teachers have neither sufficient time nor adequate expertise to deal with severe anxiety reactions. Such students, when identified, should probably be referred for specialized help to outside counselors or learning specialists [4]. Therapists employing behavior modification techniques, such as systematic desensitization, have successfully treated a variety of specific anxieties related to learning, and these techniques should prove equally useful in the case of foreign language anxiety. [page 35]

There may be things teachers can do to help with students' anxiety, but it is not their role. 

> Just as math anxiety serves as a critical job filter, channeling some women and some members of other minority groups away from high-paying, high-demand math and engineering careers, foreign language anxiety, too, may play a role in students' selections of courses, majors, and ultimately, careers (Richardson & Woolfolk, 1981).

Foreign language anxiety can limit career choices.
