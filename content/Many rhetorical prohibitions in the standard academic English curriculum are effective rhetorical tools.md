Many rhetorical prohibitions in the standard academic English curriculum are effective rhetorical tools. But these are often judged as less-than because they do not fit a our model of what "good" (read: white) language is. [[The dominant narrative of multilingual students is deficit-based]] However, [[Languages other than English should be viewed as assets rather than deficits]] [[Students who are permitted to use their other languages are able to write longer and higher quality papers in English]] This is not to say that standard academic rhetoric styles should be completely ignored. [[Engaging in reflection on multiple iterations of their work helps students understand the nuances of rhetorical choices and how they translate into writing]]

New and creative forms of expression rely on the exchange of ideas and habitus. [[The habitus discussed by Inoue is a style of communication that is adopted by a person to mark them as belonging to a particular group]] [[Habitus can be hard to confront because it has been naturalized and made invisible]] Also, [[Multicultural and plurilingual experiences can be used to teach students about critical analysis and logical fallacies]]

It would be better to have some examples of rhetorical styles from different cultures/habitus. See [[1996 Kaplan]] and rhetorical styles in writing across cultures.
