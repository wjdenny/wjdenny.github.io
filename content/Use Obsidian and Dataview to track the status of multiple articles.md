#type/statement 

[[Eleanor Konik]] uses Dataview to make a list of articles[^ytts] and sorts it by file size so she can see which articles are (generally) the most developed.

For example, each potential article can be tagged with YAML metadata; in my case, I can make it compatible with GitHub Pages and Jekyll. The metadata can track things like status, where it will be published (Konik called this the "market"), etc.
