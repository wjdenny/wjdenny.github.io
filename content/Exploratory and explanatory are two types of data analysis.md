The work of a data analysis project can be divided into two broad categories. Exploratory data analysis explores the dataset to find interesting patterns. Explanatory tries to prove those patterns to make an argument.

In my current work, for example, I teach English as a second language in higher education and often compile data on students in my class. I might look at the distribution of scores on an exam, but I'm not trying to prove anything or apply that information in any real way. If I notice that the students who tend to arrive to class early or on time are doing better, that might give me an idea for a research project. That's when explanatory data analysis comes in. Explanatory analysis would be akin to doing a study on how punctuality and attendance affect students exam scores using t-tests or ANOVA.

One explores, the other explains. I can bring the results of the explanatory data analysis project to my department and argue for more emphasis on punctuality and attendance during orientation. If I presented the exploratory analysis, it would be a lot of mess and dead-ends that would distract from my message: Students need to understand the importance of attendance and punctuality before registering for classes.
