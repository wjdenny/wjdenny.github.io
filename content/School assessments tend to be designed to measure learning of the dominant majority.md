School assessments tend to be designed to measure learning of the dominant majority.

- The concept of habitus, particularly white habitus
	- [[Apoliticality is a feature of the white habitus]]
	- [[Punctuality is another white habit of mind often imposed on students (of color) in ESL classrooms]]
- White habitus and its role in schools
	- [[Education is never ideological neutral]]
	- [[Ideological neutrality in education only serves to support the current dominant ideologies]]
	- [[Dominant academic discourses are white habits of language]]
	- [[Schools reproduce the culture of the dominant class]]
	- [[It is dangerous to ignore the ideologies inherent in TESOL]]
	- [[Many rhetorical prohibitions in the standard academic English curriculum are effective rhetorical tools]]
	- [[Several features of academic culture in the US are believed to come from a dominant WASP culture]]
- Assessment tends to measure habitus, thus enforcing it
	- [[Conventional assessment ecologies value habitus more than learning]]
	- [[Success in conventional classrooms is synonymous with adopting a white racial habitus]]
	- [[Ideological neutrality in education only serves to support the current dominant ideologies]]
	- [[The dominant narrative of multilingual students is deficit-based]]
- attempts to remove habitus from grading
	- [[Inter-rater reliability increases when the raters share habitus, but this also has consequences for students with different habitus]]
	- [[Hybrid-grading contracts, as used by Danielewicz and Elbow, fail to avoid the bias and judgement of white racial habitus]]
	- [[Hybrid-grading contracts, as used by Danielewicz and Elbow, unintentionally reserve the highest grades for students who adopt a white racial habitus]]
	- [[Anonymous grading cannot prevent reference to the norm within the class which may introduce a bias towards a white racial habitus]]
	- [[Community-based assessment merely spreads the culpability in not addressing bias towards white racial habitus]]
	- [[Criticisms of community-based assessment include failing to equalize power dynamics, as well as gender and racial biases]]
	- [[In a negotiated assessment ecology, male and white students are more likely to defend their work which therefore introduces a gender and racial bias in the grading system]]
	- [[Efforts to support one group of student can further marginalize others.]] 
- what's next? what is working?

	- [[Some pre-college outreach programs support students developing identities that blend their own cultural values with the more valued dominant culture.]] This would have to be supported in assessment methods, though.
