> [!summary] Summary

## Notes
> TG Philanthropy funded the Transparency and Problem-Centered Learning project (www.aacu.org/problemcenteredlearning) (page 31)

> the endeavor has identified a simple, replicable teaching intervention that demonstrably enhances students' success, especially that of fist-generation, low-income, and underrepresented college students n multiple ways at statistically significant levels, with a medium to large magnitude of effect. (page 31)

> While federal and state initiatives focused on tuition relief are providing greater access to higher education, they do not guarantee equity of educational experience. Black, Hispanic, Native American, and Pacific Islander students are about half as likely to complete a four-year college degree as their white and Asian classmates ([[2014 US Department of Education|US Department of Education 2014]]). (page 31)

[[White and Asian students are twice as likely to graduate than other racial and ethnic groups]]

> Completion rates for low-income students lag far behind those of students whose family incomes are above the bottom quartile ([[2014 Tough|Tough 2014]]). (page 31)

[[Low-income students are less successful in college than other students]]

> And first-generation college students are 51 percent less likely to graduate in four years than students whose parents completed college ([[2006 Ishitani|Ishitani 2006]]). (page 31)

[[First-generation college students are half as likely to graduate on time compared to other students]]

> The project's basic research question in the 2014-2015 academic year was: What is the effect when teachers provide two transparently designed, problem-based take-home assignments (compared to the unrevised, business-as-usual take-home assignments in the comparison group) on spring-term first-year college students' learning experiences, especially underserved students' experiences, as measured by
> 
> 	- the amount of transparency students perceived in the course (measured by Transparency in Learning and Teaching in Higher Education Survey Questions 36--44); (https://unlv.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9G0YyMonDPOfrX7);
> 	- students' self-ratings of three important predictors of success: academic confidence, sense of belonging, and improved mastery of skills that employers value (measured by Transparency Survey questions 4--6, 8--1, 22, 24--25, 32, 34--35);
> 	- direct assessment of students' work as indicated by scored student work samples, selected randomly (addressed elsewhere in this special issue of *Peer Review*); and
> 	- short-term retention rates
> 
> (page 31--32)

> Multiple researchers have demonstrated that increases in college students' academic confidence and sense of belonging are directly correlated with higher GPAs and persistence and retention rates, especially for underserved students. (page 32)

> Furthermore, they have demonstrated that these increases could be achieved through teaching/learning interventions. (page 32)

> ethnically underrepresented (African American) first-year college students who completed an exercise that aimed to increase their feelings of social belonging earned higher GPAs in the subsequent three years, reduced the racial achievement gap, reduced their feelings of self-doubt, increased their confidence, and were more likely to be in the top 25 percent of their college lass ([[2011 Walton & Cohen|Walton and Cohen 2011]]) (page 32)

> struggling college students increased their test scores after endorsing the belief that intelligence is not fixed but rather malleable. One year later, these students were 80 percent less likely to drop out of college, and their GPAs continued increasing ([[Aronson et al. (2002)|Aronson et al. 2002]]). (page 32)

[[Developing a growth-mindset correlates with increases in GPA and success rates for disadvantaged students]]

> For both white and African American first-year college students, sense of belonging can indirectly increase students' persistence behaviors ([[Hausmann et al. (2009)|Hausmann et al. 2009]]). (page 32)

> A 2013 study identified *transparency*-- engaging teachers and students in focusing together on *how* college students learn what they learn and *why* teachers structure learning experiences in particular ways-- as a teaching method that showed promise for improving underserved students' educational experiences in college ([[2013 Winkelmes|Winkelmes 2013]]). (page 32)

[[Transparency is a teaching intervention that educates students on how learning happens]]

> Another indicated that high-impact practices increased underserved students' engagement ([[2013 Finley and McNair|Finley and McNair 2013]]). (page 32)

> Underachieving students across a group of geographically diverse schools (high schools, in the study) experienced higher GPAs and increased pass rates after receiving two implementations of a mindset intervention that provided students with information about how they learn and the purposes for their academic work ([[Paunesku et al. (2015)|Paunesku et al. 2015]]) (page 32)

What is this mindset intervention?

> We selected an intentionally varied set of institutions to implement the project's intervention, so that any school viewing the results would find a collaborator in our group with whom they could identify (see table 1) (page 32)

Nothing specific to ESOL students, though they did say *schools* rather than *instructors*.

> many teachers struggled to keep the intervention cleanly out of their control courses after seeing students respond positively in their intervention courses. Others found it difficult to limit the intervention to only two assignments. (page 33)

> Historically underserved students in this group exceeded the three-hundred-fifty-person sample size recommended by What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) standards ([[2014 US Department of Education|US Department of Education 2014]]) (page 33)

> The results of our project suggest that faculty can contribute to increasing all students' success, especially that of underserved students, in their first year of college (when the greatest number of students drop out) ([[2015 Head and Hosteller|Head and Hosteller 2015]]). (page 33)

[[Most college students drop out in their first year]]

> In courses where students perceived more transparency as a result of receiving the transparently designed, problem-centered take-home assignments, they experienced significantly greater learning benefits compared with their classmates who perceived less transparency around assignments in a course. (page 33)

> Specifically, students who received more transparency reported gains in three areas that are important predictors of students' success: academic confidence, sense of belonging, and mastery of the skills that employers value most f when hiring. (page 33)

> WWC standards for baseline equivalence measures of 0.05 or below, sample sizes above three hundred fifty, and effect size differences above 0.25 ([[US Department of Education (2014b)|US Department of Education March 2014]]). (page 33)

> For first-generation, low-income, and underrepresented students, those benefits were larger. (page 33)

> The single largest underrepresented ethnicity group of students in our study was multiracial, with 237 students self-identifying in this category. Students who self-identified as belonging to a single underrepresented (non-white) ethnicity and students of low socio-economic status (low-income, bottom income quartile) reported statistically significant, somewhat smaller benefits in the same three areas (figs. 6 and 7). (page 33)

> Students' short-term retention rates in the more transparent courses were slightly higher than those of students in the less transparent courses. While 9.18 percent of students (65 out of 708 students) withdrew before the end of the term from the twenty-four less transparent courses where we gathered withdrawal data, only 7.50 percent of students (44 of 586 students) withdrew from the twenty-one more transparent courses where we gathered withdrawal data. In a parallel study of 1,143 University of Nevada, Las Vegas undergraduates in more transparent introductory-level courses, 90.2 percent of students returned the subsequent academic year, in contrast to the average retention rate of 74.1 percent for first-time, full-time, first-year students. (page 34-35)

> Faculty noticed increases in students' motivation in class, higher-level class discussions with sharper focus, more on-time completion of assignments, and fewer disputes about grades ([[Winkelmes et al. (2015)|Winkelmes et al. 2015]]). (page 35)
