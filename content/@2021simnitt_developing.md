# Developing Inclusive Teaching Across Writing Programs through Asset-Focused Inquiry

- [[Emily Simnitt]] and [[Thomas Tasker]] are the authors.

> [!summary] Summary
> Simnitt and Tasker looked at differences between an ESL writing program and mainstream writing program through a series of contradictions.

## Notes

> working in two separate writing programs-- an ESL writing program and a campus-wide writing program (page 125)

> we discovered additional divides: when we talked about argumentative writing, we weren't talking about the same thing. (page 125)

> we all too easily focused on what our multilingual international students *couldn't* do instead of what they *could* do. Our inquiry, we discovered, was problem-based rather than [[Asset-focused Mindset|asset-focused]]. (page 125)

[[Even well-intentioned attempts to support multilingual students are often deficit-based]]

> two sociocultural concepts facilitated the exploration of our experience: boundary crossing-- interaction across contexts that promotes learning and transformations ([[2011 Akkerman & Bakker|Akkerman & Bakker, 2011]])-- and the idea that the developmental process in individuals, in our case individual teachers, is motivated by a contradiction, a collective questioning or rejection of an established practice, which leads to a collaborative search for solutions ([[2001 Engeström|Engeström, 2001]]). (page 126)

> the contradictions reveal within and between groups became a motivating force for change ([[2010 Engström & Sannino|Engström & Sannino, 2010]]) (page 126)

> We have identified three significant institutional conditions that enabled our partnership, supported the boundary crossing, and led to development of [[Asset-focused Mindset|asset-focused]], inclusive teacher inquiry groups. The conditions were a new university president who identified "student success" as a key initiative, faculty unionization, and changing student demographics. (page 127)

> As international enrollment grew, the ESL writing program fielded requests for help from around the campus. The institute was also eager to share the expertise of its faculty, who could help the campus better understand how to integrate international students into campus culture and to see them as an asset in working toward the institutional mission of creating global citizens. (page 128)

> a Global Englishes minor with the assets of international students in mind. Although the minor project was ultimately unsuccessful, our first informal boundary crossing put us on a path to take advantage of high faculty motivation, a demonstrated student need, and the flexibility to determine informally how we wanted to spend our professional time. (page 128)

> The Academic Writing Group (AWG), led by Tom, was loosely based on Lesson Study ([[1993 Takemura & Shimizu|Takemura & Shimizu, 1993]]), in which teachers first identify a gap between the knowledge and ability their students currently have in a specific area and the knowledge and ability that teachers would like them to achieve, and then explore ways to bridge that gap by creating a research lesson, which is then taught to students (and observed by the other teachers), and finally evaluated by the group. Inquiry-based approaches to faculty development create spaces for  teachers to participate in reflective, collaborative activity, which promotes ongoing opportunities for dialogic mediation that supports teachers' conceptional development ([[2009 Johnson|Johnson, 2009]]). (page 129)

> agreed to focus on how our students struggled with paragraph development using sources. (page 126)

> We realized that most of our conversations focused on students' writing deficits, what they couldn't do, and there was almost no discussion of the assets that students could bring to the writing process. (page 130)

> a problem-based orientation.  (page 130)

> the [Inclusive Pedagogies Reading Group] is in its fourth year. Its no-preparation format removes a barrier to participating in the group and allows members from across the campus to attend as they are able. The group meetings for two hours, six times a year. Participants read selected writing research for 30 minutes and the discuss the reading in relation to their teaching practice. (page 132)

This is an interesting approach to a reading group. They do the reading in session, and also talk about it? I feel like that would not work well, but I'm interested in finding out.

> [[Asao Inoue]]'s [[Inoue (2014b)|work (2014a)]] on [[Grading Contracts|contract grading]] and the role of failure in writing assessment (page 132)

> [[2016 Rifenburg||J. Michael Rifenburg's article (2016a)]] connecting threshold concepts of writing studies ([[2015 Adler-Kassner & Wardle|Adler-Kassner & Wardle, 2015]]) to his research on prior knowledge and multiliteracies of student athletes. (page 132)

> Further, as discussions often revealed assumptions-- or contradictions about what individual members expected was happening in other sites of writing-- we, as a group, learned to stay in a place where we tried not to make assumptions about what students could or couldn't do. (page 133)

> One of the contradictions we noted early on was in how we perceived our expectations for writing and how we thought it was assessed in other sites of writing. Inoue's work on contract grading led to conversations about learning outcomes in the ESL and campus writing programs, allowing all members of the group to see what elements of writing each program highlighted. Tutors and support staff provided insight into the questions and experiences students were bringing to them. As we read more about the diverse literacy experiences of our students, these discussions provided an opportunity to consider how our understanding of grades and assessment might be transformed to create an assessment system that rewards students for drawing on their plurilingual resources. (page 133)

> I began to question my own beliefs, and thought about how I could steer students away from using sources to search for ideas that supported their answer to the essay question and toward using sources to "enter into the conversation" with the authors, and only then begin to consider their personal response. (page 135)

> The biggest change I made was to move the text analysis activities into the classroom. Giving students more guided practice working with texts might help them develop the tools they needed to become more attentive readers. (page 135)

> I continued to post three articles and asked students to read and annotate them at home, but I did not include the essay question; I did not want them to come up with an 'answer' that might influence how they read the articles. (page 135)

> The inquiry-based approach to faculty development that guided our work in the AWG, Lesson Study, ... like other inquiry-based professional development, might encourage a problem-based orientation, a focus on student deficits, and solutions that are often centered on teachers creating artifacts and practices to help students overcome learning issues. ... I started to believe that this way of thinking about student learning might be excluding the communicative resources students bring to the classroom that, when recognized and encouraged by writing instructors, could facilitate student learning. (page 135)

> The main idea of [[Grading Contracts|contract grading]] is "simple but radical: what counts ("counts" literally for the grade) is *going through the motions*. That is contract grading focuses wholeheartedly on *processes* whereas conventional grading focuses much more on products, outcomes, or results" ([[2009 Danielewicz & Elbow|Danielewicz & Elbow, 2009]], p. 260, emphasis in original). (page 136)

[[Contract grading puts emphasis on the processes that lead to learning and acquisition rather than the products]]

> The biggest change in teaching practice would involve giving students an adoption to use their first language to write their annotation notes on the articles; discuss the authors' ideas in small groups when possible; talk about their responses to the author's ideas; share ideas about how to organize their writing; and give peer feedback in discussion boards. Another change could be to encourage students to draw on their first language and English language knowledge, as well as their proficiency (aided by tools) at moving back and forth between languages, as they outline and write longer texts. I can also reduce or eliminate the grade for language accuracy, increase the grade percentage on the activities connected to the writing process, and reduce the percentage of the final grade. (page 136)

> Identify faculty with shared interests ... We would recommend taking time to investigate shared terms and areas of expertise to identify differences. (page 137)
