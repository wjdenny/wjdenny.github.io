## Notes
> According to McCabe (2001), a self-report survey on academic dishonesty, 40 percent of American college students report having “copied a few sentences without citation.” 

[[Nearly half of American college students report committing at least minor acts of plagiarism]]

> Add to this the challenges international students face such as: less exposure to Western academic culture, lack of confidence in referencing abilities (Volkov, et al., 2011), and a difference in cultural values surrounding the concepts of intellectual property and authorship (see Liu, 2005; Sowden, 2005a; Sowden, 2005b), and we can begin to see the discrepancy between institutional policies on academic fraud and students’ understanding of plagiarism.

[[International students are less acquainted with Western academic culture]]

[[International students are less confident in their ability to accurately reference source material]]

[[There are differences in cultural attitudes towards intellectual property and authorship]]

> Awareness of what constitutes plagiarism is often lacking among new university students (Devlin & Gray, 2007; Volkov, et al., 2012)

[[New university students, not just international students, lack awareness of how plagiarism is defined]]

> An interview with an international student in the study suggests there is a conflict between the perfectly standard rote memorization from his former schools at home and the concept of plagiarism in the host university. Plagiarism committed from this misunderstanding seems to be largely unintentional.

[[Some cultures take the view that quoting an author implies doubt or disrespect]]

> Another interview revealed that plagiarism could also occur as a result of poor language skills (particularly in paraphrase) or a lack of confidence in these skills. Further, the awareness of plagiarism may exist, but the crime can be committed in spite of efforts to cite, paraphrase or quote by an unpracticed knowledge of these skills.

[[Proper referencing and citation is a complex language skill that is often not thoughtfully introduced in the classroom]]

> Landau, et al., found group 2 (examples and discussion) to be the only group to reach statistical significance; they produced material with less content from the original passage. There was no significant difference between the feedback and the combined feedback and examples groups.

[[Feedback and discussion of plagiarism examples proved more effective at helping students avoid plagiarism than feedback alone, or feedback with additional examples]]

> First, the term ‘mosaic plagiarism’ refers to the use of text from multiple, unacknowledged sources, pieced together and containing no original content. For this reason, we recommend including two original passages in the worksheet. The paraphrase items can then have the option of including material and ideas from both passages. Patch writing, while similar to mosaic plagiarism, differs in that there is original content mixed into the plagiarized material. Further types of plagiarism can be categorized as mechanical, or related to the improper use of punctuation (such as in a citation) or quotation conventions (such as ellipsis for deleted material, or brackets for added material).

[[Types of plagiarism include mosaic plagiarism, patch writing, and mechanical plagiarism]]

> The instructor should also help students develop a habit of shorthand, abbreviation, and acronyms to keep up with the pace of a lecture.

Looking back, I no longer think it is helpful to say what instructions should do without also explaining why and how. Also, I disagree that students should need to develop these skills to keep up with the pace of a lecture, and now share the view with [[AL2.4 - Expert Insights|ACUE]] that all students should be provided with skeletal outlines of lecture material to facilitate learning rote material and free up cognitive resources for discussion, application, and active learning activities.

> Examples of grammatical techniques to paraphrase text would be transforming a sentence from active to passive and preposing adverbial or prepositional phrases rather than leaving them in-situ (and vice-versa).
