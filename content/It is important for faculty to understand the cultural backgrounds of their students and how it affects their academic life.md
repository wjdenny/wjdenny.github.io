It is important for faculty to understand the cultural backgrounds of their students and how it affects their academic life. [[Many students with diverse cultural backgrounds have strongly held cultural attitudes towards education and learning that may be difficult to change]] [[Students with diverse cultural backgrounds often do not feel that copying or cheating is a problem]] [[There can be a strong cultural preference for students engaging in counter-productive collaborative work]]

[[Multilingual students experience greater challenges in using school learning management systems]]
[[International students often choose majors that they are not interested in]] perhaps due to family pressures.
