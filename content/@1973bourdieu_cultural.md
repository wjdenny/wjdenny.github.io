## Notes
> The science of the reproduction of structures, understood as a system of objective relations which impart their relational properties to individuals whom they pre-exist and survive, has nothing in common with the analytical recording of relations existing within a given population, be it a question of the relations between the academic success of children and the social position of their family or of the relations between the positions filled by children and their parents [page 71]

> the sociology of educational institutions and, in particular, of institutions of higher education, is capable of making a decisive contribution to the science of the structural dynamics of class relations, which is an often neglected aspect of the sociology of power. [page 72]

> these theories are based upon the implicit assumption that the different pedagogic actions [...] carried out by families from the different social classes as well as that which is practised by the school, work together in a harmonious way to transmit a cultural heritage which is considered as being the undivided property of the whole society. [page 72--73]

> the action of the educational system can attain full effectiveness only to the extent that it bears upon individuals who have been previously granted a certain familiarity with the world of art by their family upbringing. Indeed, it would seem that the action of the school, whose effect is unequal (if only from the point of view of duration) among children from different social classes, and whose success varies considerably among those upon whom it has an effect, tends to reinforce and to consecrate by its sanctions the initial inequalities. [page 79]

> By doing away with giving explicitly to everyone what it implicitly demands of everyone, the educational system demands of everyone alike that they have what it does not give. This consists mainly of linguistic and cultural competence and that relationship of familiarity with culture which can only be produced by family upbringing when it transmits the dominant culture. [page 80]

> In short, an institution officially entrusted with the transmission of the instruments of appropriation of the dominant culture which neglects methodically to transmit the instruments indispensable to the success of its undertaking is bound to become the monopoly of those social classes capable of transmitting by their own means, that is to say by that diffuse and implicit continuous educational action which operates within cultured families (often unknown to those responsible for it and to those who are subjected to it), the instruments necessary for the reception of its message, and thereby to confirm their monopoly of the instruments of appropriation of the dominant culture and thus their monopoly of that culture.  [page 80--81]

> he negative predispositions towards the school which result in the self-elimination of most children from the most culturally unfavoured classes and sections of a class---such as self-depreciation, devaluation of the school and its sanctions, or a resigned attitude to failure and exclusion---must be understood as an anticipation, based upon the unconscious estimation of the objective probabilities of success possessed by the whole category, of the sanctions objectively reserved by the school for those classes or sections of a class deprived of cultural capital. [page 83]

He's describing a sort of self-selection of how much education a person seeks out based on their classed upbringing. This is also one way that immigrant community college students are excluded from some programs or "guided" to specific programs; even if they had the classed upbringing to aim for higher degrees.

> the system of dispositions towards the school, understood as a propensity to consent to the investments in time, effort, and money necessary to conserve or increase cultural capital, tends to redouble the symbolic and economic effects of the uneven distribution of cultural capital, all the while concealing it and, at the same time, legitimating it. [page 83]

Wealthy families are able to invest more into the education of their children, thus building cultural capital.

> The functionalist sociologists who announce the brave new world when, at the conclusion of a longitudinal study of academic and social careers, they discover that, as though by a pre-established harmony, individuals have hoped for nothing that they have not obtained and obtained nothing that they have not hoped for, are simply the least forgivable victims of the ideological effect which is produced by the school when it cuts off from their social conditions of production all predispositions regarding the school such as 'expectations', 'aspirations', 'inclinations', or 'desire', and thus tends to cover up the fact that objective conditions---and in the individual case, the laws of the academic market---determine aspirations by determining the extent to which they can be satisfied. [page 83]

I think what he's saying here is that the functionalist sociologists had found that there was balance because lower classes had the jobs and other things they wanted and did not yearn for the trapping of higher classes; and vice versa. But he's pointing out that this misses the fact that people are *conditioned* by their classed upbringing to want specific things.

> By making social hierarchies and the reproduction of these hierarchies appear to be based upon the hierarchy of 'gifts', merits, or skills established and ratified by its sanctions, or, in a word, by converting social hierarchies into academic hierarchies, the educational system fulfils a function of legitimation which is more and more necessary to the perpetuation of the 'social order [page 84]

This sleight of hand transforming aristocracy to meritocracy but being still the same sounds similar to the idea of despotism to democracy.

> The objective mechanisms which enable the ruling classes to keep the monopoly of the most prestigious educational establishments, while continually appearing at least to put the chance of possessing that monopoly into the hands of every generation, are concealed beneath the cloak of a perfectly democratic method of selection which takes into account only merit and talent, and these mechanisms are of a kind which converts to the virtues of the system the members of the dominated classes whom they eliminate in the same way as they convert those whom they elect, and which ensures that those who are 'miraculously elected' may experience as 'miraculous' an exceptional destiny which is the best testimony of academic democracy. [page 85]

This is why those rags-to-riches stories that American society likes to exemplify as indicative of the ability of everyone to "pull themselves up by their bootstraps" is complete bullshit. Bourdieu is saying that the ways top schools are able to effectively select their students is hidden behind this illusion of meritocracy, while the few that are able to cross class lines and make there way through are touted as examples of how meritocratic the system is.

> a very pronounced correlation may be observed between academic success and the family's cultural capital measured by the academic level of the forbears over two generations on both sides of the family) [page 86]

I wonder if this holds true for our immigrant students as well.

> the most privileged sections of the dominant classes from the point of view of economic capital and power are not necessarily the most well-off in terms of cultural capital, it may be expected that the hierarchy of values attributed by the academic market to the products of the educational work of the families of the different sections will not correspond very closely to the hierarchy of these sections with regard to economic capital and power. [page 86]

I think he's referring to groups like primary and secondary school teachers. They have higher cultural capital relative to their economic capital. 

>  If the proportion of individuals who do not possess television (and who are distinguished from the possessors of that instrument by the fact that they go in more often for activities commonly held to be the expression of an authentically 'cultured' or refined disposition) varies according to the same law, it is because a refusal to indulge in this activity, which is suspected of being 'vulgar' by reasons of its wide availability (divulgation), is one of the least expensive ways of expressing cultural pretensions (see Table 6). [page 88]

> A number of indicators suggest that the different sections of the dominant classes can also be distinguished according to the amount of free time at their disposal. Thus, for example, the proportion of individuals who go on holiday varies from 95 per cent for teachers, to 92 per cent for engineers, 91 per cent for civil servants, 89 per cent for professionals, 87 per cent for managers, and 81 and 80 per cent for heads of industry and of commerce. The effect of this principle of differentiation is to be seen in a number of activities possessed of a cultural dimension, such as the use of radio or television. [page 106]

Divulgation here refers to the wide availability of television sets; that is, making it vulgar in the sense of having to do with commoners.

> Analysis of the mobility between sections tends to show that the dominant principle of the hierarchy formed by the sections is the possession of economic capital---to the extent, at least, that it is very closely linked to the possession of power. Thus, examination of the intra-generational mobility of the individuals from the different sections who are part of the *Who's Who* census reveals that the proportion of individuals who have moved towards the bottom of the hierarchy during their career, which is more or less nil among business and industrial management, increases more and more as one descends the hierarchy of the sections as it is formed according to the economic criterion [page 89--90]

Downward mobility tends not to happen among upper classes, but increases as one goes down in class.

> the professionals (and especially lawyers and doctors) invest in their children's education but also and above all in consumer goods capable of symbolizing the possession of the material and cultural means of conforming to the rules governing the bourgeois style of life and thereby guaranteeing a social capital or capital of social relationships which will provide, if necessary, useful 'supports': a capital of honourability and respectability which is often indispensable if one desires to attract clients in socially important positions, and which may serve as currency, for instance, in a political career. [page 93]
