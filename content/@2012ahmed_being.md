Process of stranger-making
who belongs in the institution?

> Feminists of color have o√ered some of the most cogent critiques of the language of diversity (Davis 1996; Carby 1999; Bannerji 2000; Lewis 2000; Mohanty 2003; Puwar 2004; Alexander 2005; Anzaldúa and Keating 2009). Feminists of color have explored the relationship between diversity and power by showing how diversity is incorporated by institutions: ‘‘diversity management’’ becomes a way of managing or containing conﬂict or dissent. In particular, Chandra Talpade Mohanty’s Feminism without Borders and M. Jacqui Alexander’s Pedagogies of Crossing are important precursors to On Being Included. In these books, Mohanty and Alexander attend to the grammar of diversity and o√er substantive critiques of diversity as a practice within educational institutions (Mohanty 2003: 208–16; Alexander 2005: 133–44). Mohanty shows how diversity is a discourse of ‘‘benign variation,’’ which ‘‘bypasses power as well as history to suggest a harmonious empty pluralism’’ (2003: 193). Alexander explores how diversity documents have an ideological function in the ‘‘manufacture of cohesion’’ and create the impression of ‘‘more diversity’’ than ‘‘actually exists’’ (2005: 135). Following both these authors, this book interrogates diversity as a set of practices, asking how diversity can participate in the creation of an idea of the institution that allows racism and inequalities to be overlooked.

two precursors to this book; 

feminism of color, intersectionality

there's issues with using diversity as a performance indicator
