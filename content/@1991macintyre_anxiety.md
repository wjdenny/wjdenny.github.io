## Notes
> The final study cited by [[@1991scovel_effect|Scovel]] (Kleinmann, 1977) considered two types of anxiety, facilitating and debilitating (see Alpert & Haber, 1960). Facilitating anxiety is considered to be an asset to performance and showed the predicted positive correlations with Arabic students' willingness to attempt difficult linguistic structures in English. Debilitating anxiety, which is the more common interpretation of "anxiety," is considered to be detrimental to performance, but did not show the expected negative correlations with performance. In summary, [[@1991scovel_effect|Scovel (1978, this volume)]] stated that foreign language anxiety research suffered from several ambiguities. [page 41]

I may have misunderstood [[@1991scovel_effect]]'s point on debilitating anxiety.

> [[@1991horwitz_foreign|Horwitz, Horwitz, and Cope (1986, this volume)]] make a similar statement almost a decade after [[@1991scovel_effect|Scovel's review]]. As a remedy, they outline a theoretical framework from which to begin. [[@1991horwitz_foreign|Horwitz, Horwitz, and Cope (1986, this volume)]] describe three components of foreign language anxiety. The first is communication apprehension. They propose that the language student has mature thoughts and ideas but an immature second language vocabulary with which to express them. The inability either to express oneself or to comprehend another person leads to frustration and apprehension. The second component, closely related to the first, is fear of negative social evaluation. Because students are unsure of themselves and what they are saying, they may feel that they are not able to make the proper social impression. The third component is test anxiety, viz., apprehension over academic evaluation. The pedagogical requirements of the school and teacher require that the student continually be assessed on aspects of proficiency while it is being acquired. These three components then, communication apprehension, fear of social evaluation, and test anxiety, are viewed by Horwitz and colleagues to have a deleterious effect on second language acquisition. [page 41--42]

Horwitz et al. proposed three components of foreign language anxiety: communication apprehension, fear of negative evaluation, and test anxiety.

> The concept of second language anxiety has also been investigated in the context of attitudes and motivation and their relationship to proficiency. Because the primary focus is on attitudes and motivation, detailed information is not always given about the relationship of anxiety to proficiency. The Attitudes and Motivation Test Battery (AMTB) contains the French Class Anxiety Scale (Gardner, 1985). This scale measures the degree to which students report feeling embarrassed or anxious in language class. It has shown strong reliability (Gardner, Smythe, and Lalonde, 1984). The concern of most studies that use the AMTB has been with larger issues of attitudes and motivation, rather than the more specific role of any single construct such as anxiety. However, both the global and the specific issues deserve attention, and it is worthwhile to look more closely at the results of some of these studies to gain some insight into the specific role of foreign language anxiety in the language-learning process. [page 42]

> Using regression procedures, both Gliksman (1981) and Trylong (1987) found that the addition of French class anxiety scores to an equation already containing attitude and motivation indices resulted in a significant improvement in a prediction. Trylong (1987) concluded that aptitude, attitudes, and anxiety "interact in unique and powerful ways as they relate to achievement (p. 65)" [page 42]

Language-specific anxiety measurements increase the explanatory power of attitude and motivation-based predictions.

> Gardner (1985) has proposed that scales directly concerned with foreign language anxiety are more appropriate for studying language anxiety than are general anxiety scales. [page 42--43]

Foreign language anxiety scales can predict outcomes better than general anxiety scales.

> Tobias (1979, 1980, 1986) has proposed a model of the effects of anxiety on learning fro instruction. She suggests that anxious persons tend to engage in self-directed, derogatory cognition rather than focusing on the task itself. These task-irrelevant thoughts compete with task-relevant ones for limited cognitive resources. Nonanxious individuals tend not to engage in such self-preoccupations, giving them an advantage when the task at hand is taxing. This theory helps explain the often-cited finding of an interaction among anxiety, task difficulty, and ability (Hunsley, 1985; Sarason, 1986; Spielberger, 1983). [page 43]

Anxiety interferes with task-related thought to reduce performance.

> The present study has two major goals. First, the [[@1991horwitz_foreign|Horwitz, Horwitz, and Cope (1986, this volume)]] theory will be evaluated as a theoretical framework from which foreign language anxiety research can proceed. Several relevant anxiety scales will be factor-analyzed to determine the dimensionality that underlies them. Second, the theory of Tobias (1986) will be used to propose the mechanism by which foreign language anxiety may operate. 

> According to Tobias (1986), in order for highly anxious subjects to improve, relative too those low in anxiety, the should be given the opportunity to compensate for their misdirected attention by reviewing the material to be learned.  [page 51]

Tobias argues that anxious students should review material before evaluation.
M & G also argue that anxious students should be given more time to complete tasks.

> The orthogonal factors generated in the analysis of the anxiety scales indicate that foreign language anxiety is distinct from general anxiety, which possibly accounts for the poor relationship of general anxiety and second language proficiency. The factor analysis suggests that foreign language anxiety may be part of a larger construct that could be labeled Communicative Anxiety. [page 53]

Foreign language anxiety is distinct from general anxiety.
Foreign language anxiety is considered a subset of communication anxiety.

> Both the theories of [[@1991horwitz_foreign|Horwitz, Horwitz, and Cope (1986, this volume)]] and Tobias (1986) were supported by the results of this study. Horwitz et al. (1986, this volume) proposed a tri-partite description of foreign language anxiety with communication apprehension, fear of social evaluation, and test anxiety as the components. Only test anxiety did not emerge as an important factor in the present study. Tobias's (1986) model of learning from instruction also received support. Clearly anxiety was shown to influence both the learning (input/processing) and the production (output) of French vocabulary. [page 53]

[[@1991horwitz_foreign]] and Tobias (1986) were supported by this study.
