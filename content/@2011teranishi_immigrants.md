## Rhetorical Précis
[[Robert T. Teranishi]], [[Carola Suárez-Orozco]], and [[Marcelo Suárez-Orozco]], in their article titled "Immigrants in Community Colleges", argue that the success and inclusion of immigrants should be a national priority and a clear path to support them is through the community college system. They support this claim by highlighting the role that community colleges play in social and economic mobility while remaining affordable and finally drawing a connection between the success of college-age immigrant children and the health of the nation. The article's purpose is to draw attention to the need for support of immigrant students in college. They adopt a formal and urgent tone for the readers of [[The Future of Children]] and others interested in the topic of adolescent and young adult development.
## Notes
[[Social and economic capital can provide advantages to students in higher education.]]

[[The population of linguistic minority students is growing quickly]]

>High-quality faculty are essential to the effectiveness of ESL programs in terms of student learning gains, retention, and transition to regular academic classes.  Although the research on qualifications of effective faculty members is thin, some experts recommend that all ESL faculty have a master's degree in either Teachers of English to Students of Other Languages or applied linguistics, as well as experience working with adult ESL students. They also recommend that ESL courses and resources be placed in academic departments with tenure-track faculty positions, rather than in an English department, a remedial education department, or an adjunct division. These recommendations seem reasonable, but until more research is conducted, it is difficult to determine whether they will boost the English skills of immigrant students. [page 162]

[[EAP faculty should be highly qualified and tenured to more effectively support resident immigrant students in college.]]
