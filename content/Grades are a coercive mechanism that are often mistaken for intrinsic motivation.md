[[Studies show some students benefit from contract grading in terms of motivation and learning, but results were mixed]]

For example, [[McGarrell promotes a classroom ecology that avoids instructor evaluation in the form of grades, but does not preclude extensive feedback]]

[[There are some concerns that students who are habitually motivated by grades do not do well in labor-based grading systems including hybrid grading contracts]]

[[Working-class students have a better experience in learning when it is framed as work or labor]]
