### What is implicit bias and how is it different from conscious bias?
**[[Teresa A. Nance]], PhD; Vice President, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion; Chief Diversity Officer; Associate Professor; [[Villanova University]]**
As we begin to talk about bias, I think it's going to be important to start with some definitions. And basically when we talk about ==**conscious bias**==, we're talking about ==**a preference that is, that is under your conscious understanding==**. It is something that you know about, that you claim, and that you know **influences your actions**. So that if we look at someone who says, I hate fill in the blank and then I act out and I try to hurt fill in the blank, that is what I would call conscious bias. And I have to tell you that in my experience in higher ed, I don't actually see a lot of that. But rather what I see is **==implicit== or unconscious bias**. And that would be bias that **exists ==outside of our level of awareness==**. When we begin to talk about implicit or unconscious bias, we're almost talking about the **programing that comes to us courtesy of our culture, whether that is family culture or societal culture**. That we develop preferences for or against people, places, or actions. And **the problem with those implicit biases is ==because we don't own them== and we don't consciously have control of them, ==they can influence our actions in very disturbing ways== as a teacher**. And implicit bias could begin to influence the way in which I will hear a student's answer.

So the issue is that we all have implicit biases and these biases consist of past experiences, stereotypes, images and ideas that are constantly repeated in the media. And unfortunately, ==**whether we agree with these ideas or not, that's still information that gets stored in the brain**==. And because in the media, for example, we're all subject to so many negative stereotypes about people of color, particularly Black men, that **even if we have lots of counterexamples to that, those negative stereotypes remain accessible in our brain and ==may come out in situations where we are under stress== or pressed for time and not thinking about our thinking**, and we may respond. Now, there is such a taboo around being called racist. Nobody wants to be racist. But it is also true that **some of these embedded ideas that we have are in fact racist**. But that doesn't mean that we ourselves are racist. But it's undeniable that there is a connection. But they are separate, separate ideas. And if we can't separate them, if we can't, **if we can't talk about our implicit biases, we'll never be able to weaken them** or mitigate them or deal with them.
