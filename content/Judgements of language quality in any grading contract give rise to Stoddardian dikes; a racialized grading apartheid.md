[[Language is learned through a racialized habitus and we make the mistake of assuming all students have adopted a white racial habitus]] [[Academic language is a product of white colonial norms and similarly tries to avoid racial emotions]]

[[Teachers can connect language and identity work in the classroom to future benefits through job applications, scholarships, and other opportunities]] It could even be argued that regardless of what they do, teachers are doing this. If left to unconscious biases, the result will be reinforcing those dikes.

[[Literacy is white property and grading is used to exclude non-white bodies from its use]]

[[Students who have or are adjacent to privilege may not notice the struggle of adopting a white language habitus that other students do]]

[[Comparing what students do with what you were expected to do when you were in college is an unconscious dog whistle, or red flag, for enforcing habits of white languaging, and through it, white supremacy]]
