[[Eleanor Konik]] captures widely, and then when she is ready to start brainstorming ideas for a project, she searches keywords in her vault and compiles a list of links and ideas. This is what she calls the discovery process.

This is different from my approach so far, because I was reading things specific to the project I wanted to work on, typing literature notes for those sources, and then compiling it together in that way. 

Not too different, I guess, just different in terms of how recent the literature notes were made compared to when they were used. By the time she wrote the outline for her project, she had dozens of notes on the topic. I think that's just the value that having an established network of knowledge gives us.
