### How can we work to mitigate the potential impact of bias?
**Jennifer Imazeki, PhD; Associate Chief Diversity Officer for Faculty and Staff, Professor of Economics; San Diego State University**
I think the most important thing an instructor can do to make their course and their course materials more inclusive is to **start with some ==self reflection== about those implicit biases**, about their own experience, about their students. **Who are your students? How are your students different? Are they different from you in terms of their life experiences, their social identities, and those sorts of things?** Understanding or think, just thinking about who your students are in that regard can help you think, then **when I approach my course and my course materials, what do I need to do?** **What will be interesting and relevant to all of my students?** So I really think that the first step has to be just reflecting on who you are and who yourr students are.  

[[The first step to managing implicit biases is to reflect on them and to get feedback from other people]]

Well, I think it's particularly important, again, when we're dealing with students and you catch yourself making a judgment or assumption about students. And this is one of the ways to mitigate biases, actually kind of doing some thinking about your thinking. So oftentimes we're making an assumption or judgment about a student based on a past experience, probably with other students, maybe with that student, right? So we go to the quickest, most available information. And if we can ==**catch ourselves doing that==, then we can stop, slow down in our thinking, see what information we may be missing, ask some, ask some questions, to just confirm the information**. I think the importance of **reflecting on your past experiences should be in the context of understanding how your brain works and understanding how all those past experiences are bits of information that are stored in the brain**. And if you are not careful, that information will be used to evaluate and judge others.

Not there yet. But getting good, equitable teaching is you have to be, **put yourself in a position where you're going to get ==feedback from other people**== because you can say, "I'm all that and a bag of chips." And if you teach with somebody else, they go, "You know, you never call on \_\_\_." And you go, "Wow, I didn't know I did that." Or they'll say, "You know, you always cut off \_\_\_."

There's a lot of ways to mitigate biases with your students. So if you have a smaller class, for example, and you have the opportunity to ==**meet one-on-one with students==, not only does that help build trust with that student, but it helps you individuate or individualize that particular student**. So you will be less reliant on stereotypes or assumptions that you may have from past experiences. Now in a larger class, which a lot of instructors find themself in, you may not have the time to meet with 100 or 200 students individually. So in those cases, it might be helpful to **implement practices that help mitigate the biases for you. So, for example, ==anonymous grading==**, I know a lot of the LMSs, the learning management systems, these days offer an option for anonymous grading. There is also ways to look at your discussion forums and keep track of who you're speaking to or replying to in the online discussions, or as well as if you're in a Zoom session. So putting practices into place. And I think even just the idea that you're trying to be aware of your biases helps you mitigate them, because, again, they come into play when you're not aware, when you're stressed, you're moving forward full speed ahead, multitasking. But if you're consciously doing things to avoid drawing upon those cognitive shortcuts, you'll be more successful.

It's those assumptions that are so deeply embedded in us that we feel as though that there is no room or no need for discussion. As our classrooms grow more diverse and we welcome that diversity, part of that diverse, welcoming diversity means **I need to also work on my clarity**. I have to be able to really be clear about what I mean, so that when I say I want you to be on time for class, I will say, "give or take five minutes," just so that now we have the parameters established. And I can imagine that there's going to be somebody out there who will go, "on time means on time." And I would simply say "to you." You have to add that "to you," and that if you really care about your students and you're not just interested in penalizing your students, then **taking those extra steps in ==clarifying what you mean== becomes so important**. Now, we can extend from that on-time example to almost any classroom sort of rule or or even direction. I want you to write a, you know, I want you to write a medium-size essay. How long is that?

Our unconscious or **==implicit biases are basically neuropathways in the brain==; they're these cognitive shortcuts**. And they do not get erased. They cannot be overwritten. But they can be overridden when you make a conscious choice in the moment when you notice it is happening and choose otherwise or think about your thinking, or implement other strategies, cognitive strategies to recognize those biases. And again, over time they can become weakened, but they won't be erased.
