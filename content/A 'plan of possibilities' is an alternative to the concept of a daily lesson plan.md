A 'plan of possibilities' is an alternative to the concept of a daily lesson plan.
A 'plan of possibilities' is an alternative to the concept of a daily lesson plan. It is not a set-in-stone agenda of each period, but rather a map of possible activities. Because each semester can deviate from a reusable plan more or less dramatically, [[Evan Tobias]] develops a Plan of Possibilities to outline all of the potential possibilities for lessons to use during the semester. More concrete planning can then be done for a smaller number of weeks ahead.

Sometimes students bring up topics or ask questions about something planned later in the semester and would make it more appropriate to use that plan now or next class instead of waiting. 

[[Plan of possibilities helps us avoid the mentality of simply covering content and allow us to design in a student-centered way]]
