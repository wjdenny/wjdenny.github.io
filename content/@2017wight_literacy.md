## Notes
> Inaugurated in 1964 as a result of the Civil Rights Movement, the federally funded Upward Bound (UB) program helps underrepresented students succeed in their pre-college performance and postsecondary pursuits. Spawning a number of similar programs, UB remains the largest, serving approximately 60,000 students each year (Calahan & Curtain, 2004). [page 117]

[[History of college support programs]]

> many linguistic minorities (LMs) come from families with low levels of income and parental education, the two main eligibility requirements for the program (Kanno & Harklau, 2012).

> UB's academically driven peer cohort profoundly impacted students' writing. Specifically, I argue here that participants' high school and UB peers acted as sponsors of literacy: "any agents, local or distant, concrete or abstract, who enable support, teach, and model as well as regulate, suppress, or withhold literacy" (Brandt, 2001, p. 15). [page 117--118]

> Numerous studies on linguistically diverse students have documented the deleterious effects of tracking. Harklau (1994) found that schools conflated academic ability and language proficiency, disproportionately placing LMs within lower levels. [page 118]

> Despite increasing English proficiency, institutional inertia and students' own acceptance of labels often prevented advancement. Davidson (1996) and Oakes (2005) have also revealed the many ways in which tracking led to social division among peers, creating distrust and stereotyping among diverse students. [page 118]

> Tracking has also restricted multilingual students' access to academic writing, which is inextricably linked to their academic trajectories (Enright & Gilliland, 2011; Fu, 1995). This limited access to writing is compounded by peer relationships within these courses.  Ortmeier-Hooper (2010), for instance, discovered that LMs emulated peers in remedial courses by avoiding rigorous writing assignments. Noting tracking's threat to educational advancement, Ortmeier-Hooper and Enright (2011) have coined the term "cycle of inopportunity" to refer to these reciprocal influences between tracking, identity, peer interactions, and access to academic writing (p. 175). In order to improve college access for LMs, interventions must break this cycle. [page 118]

ESL and ELA can be compared to illustrate tracking. Students in ESL who move on to take credit courses at the college do not have that label attached to their student record. It is not possible to look up the record to see if a student had attended ESL without getting past roster data from that program. In contrast, ELA students are tracked with an academic hold in their student record, and that hold remains visible by college staff even after the hold has been released.

On one hand though, this makes it possible to do research on ELA student success as they progress through the college that would be much more difficult to do on ESL students. But at what cost?

> [Pre-college outreach program] participants enroll in college at higher rates than control groups (Calahan & Curtain, 2004; Engle, 2007; Gándara, 2002). [page 118]

> Cazden (2022), for instance, found that [Puente's] literacy curriculum gave participants opportunities to develop hybrid identities and bicultural competencies by blending instrumental culture, the skills necessary for social advancement, with expressive culture, their own values and interpersonal connections. [page 119]

[[Some pre-college outreach programs support students developing identities that blend their own cultural values with the more valued dominant culture.]]

> Pradl (2002) has also tied the program's success to its model of professional development, which emphasizes teacher research, ongoing collaboration, and writing alongside students. [page 119]

> Research has often revealed negligible improvement in participants' GPAs and test scores, since most programs target high school students with less time for academic preparation (Calahan & Curtain, 2004; Gándara, 2022). [page 119]

> TRIO, which encompasses UB, only serves 10% of the eligible student population, a number dwindling from ongoing budget cuts (Engle, 2007; Swail, 2000). [page 119]

> While originally focusing on professional apprenticeships, CoP's relevance to other learning environments has made it useful for examining second language writing in classrooms (Haneda, 2006; Morita, 2004; Toohey, 1996) and online spaces (Yi, 2010). [page 119]

> Lave and Wegner (1991) first articulated this concept as part of their situated-learning theory to balance social and cognitive perspectives on learning. [page 119]

> **In CoPs, learning emerges through legitimate peripheral participation (LPP), a process through which novices acquire the requisite skills needed to display mastery and become full members.** Extending this work, Wegner (1998) has defined CoPs as groups of people who negotiate meaning through mutual engagement, a joint enterprise, and a shared repertoire. This negotiation of meaning emerges from participation, ongoing social interpretations of the world, and reification, fossilized understandings. [page 119]

This is sounding a lot like the Natural Approach in language acquisition. See: [[@1991koch_affective#^929de5]] and the difference between learning and acquisition.

[[Learning and acquisition are distinct neurological processes.]] Acquisition is the development of a myriad of interrelated habits and is socially mediated.

> In this framework, learning is tied to identity. Specifically, Wegner (1998) has argued that learning transforms community members. Identity formation within CoPs is an ongoing process of identification-- association and differentiation-- and negotiation, ability to control or contribute meanings within the community. In addition to these ongoing formations, whoever, certain identities can become fossilized into social labels. Individuals' sense of selfhood emerges from associating and differentiating themselves from communities. [page 119--120]

> Sometimes, however, participation is marginalized among some members of the community whose contributions are rejected or ignored. For this reason, one's place within the community is as important as membership itself. [page 120]

> Beyond any particular community, **individuals have to reconcile their identity across a "nexus of multi-memberships" that may carry conflicting forms of participation (p. 149). For this reason, individuals follow unique trajectories of participation within and between communities.** [page 120]

> > If students are fearful of being humiliated, either by a teacher or fellow students, they will not offer opinions or take risks, will not engage in discussion, and will do their best to be invisible. However, if students are not fearful, they will begin to find their voices.

> Multiple opportunities for peer feedback, small class sizes, and one-on-one attention from the teacher and a tutor provided opportunities for legitimate peripheral participation (LPP) as students revised their essays to gain and demonstrate increasing competence. [page 122]

> > We design the groups so that they are diverse as possible. All the high schools we serve are represented, and students from the same school are often in different grades and programs. Racial, ethnic, and gender diversity are all part of the mix.

> To address "unhealthy disagreements" that might emerge from these diverse groupings, UB had initiated a No Discount Policy and Ceremony (UB Staff Manual). In an initiation rite at the start of the program, administrators, staff, and then each of the five student groups stood in concentric circles and lit each others' candles as symbols of support before affirming their "full respect for the inherent worth of each person and for that person's feelings, opinions, ideas, and well being." They then pledged to "not put one another down, put ourselves down, or disregard our own needs." Within this ceremony, the symbolic gestures of lighting one another's lames and configuring themselves into circles were intended to create an embodied response to the words of the pledge and provided concrete tokens to symbolize the group's communal values. Afterward, participants shared what the policy meant to them. In often tearful testimonials, returning students expressed how the policy helped them be themselves and explore new possibilities. After hearing these prototypical experiences, newcomers joined in by sharing what they hoped to achieve in the program. At the end of the ceremony, students were asked to state, "No D," any time they heard community members discounting themselves or anyone else. [page 122]

> In April 2014, the U.S. Department of Education found that information barriers, standardized testing, and the policy of failing students who dropped to a lower level midterm excluded LMs in the district from college preparatory courses. [page 123]

> he seemed to have accepted institutional labels, attributing LMs' remedial status to laziness: "I know a lot of minorities [at my school] really don't want to learn. Some people just use the ESL thing as a way to pass a test." For both participants, the school's rigid categories cast LMs as marginalized members. [page 123]

> The level of trust he experienced at UB also influenced his writerly identity. Jared believed he could negotiate meanings within the UB community and found social interactions there authentic. For instance, he felt the No Discount Policy challenged cliques, enabling him to be himself and share his writing [page 124]

> Specifically, Jared worried that in high school, other students might laugh at what he wrote or the amount of time it took him to complete a paper. [page 124]

[[Student perceptions of peer reactions influence their willingness to engage in academic activities.]] For better or worse, I think; see: [[Peer behavior was found to be a major predictor of student cheating]]

> questions over the outcome of the surgery helped him add detail and gain audience awareness [page 124]

I've tried peer feedback before a few times, but students never seem to get it and either a) wait for the instructor to tell them how to respond, or b) respond in ways counter to instruction or advice. I think this would have to do with students lack of investment in the assignment itself, but also in the peer feedback activity.

> noting that the UB experience instilled the necessary confidence to address the whole class. [page 125]

> Due to cliques within science, Jared was uncomfortable asking questions in class and, though struggling with reports, refused to seek his lab partner's assistance. [page 125]

> While participation in UB had positive impacts on Jared's academic writing, his identifications with high school classmates sometimes interfered with these practices. [page 125]

> For Ariel, this emphasis on integration conflicted with high school practices, and she found it difficult to reconcile identities across communities. [page 125]

> Feeling little control over her participation, she characterized its social interactions as inauthentic, complaining, "People in UB are too nice, and when people are too nice, they want something from you." [page 126]

There is a need for balance between "No Discount" and toxic positivity.

> Such superficial references to the No Discount Policy illustrated Ariel's reluctance to accept UB practices and abandon negative institutional labels. In offering her own feedback, Ariel complained that the No Discount Policy prevented her from being honest. [page 126]

> Ariel also rejected help or feedback from other UB peers. Out of the five case study participants, she was the only one who did not revise in response to peer feedback. However, when teachers and tutors offered similar suggestions, she revised her essay accordingly. [page 126]

> When I pointed this out to Ariel during a member check, she attributed her response to a lack of trust and a sense of laziness. In many ways, then, peer schisms hindered her writing process. [page 126]

I can recall students like this during peer review sessions. I've had students directly tell me they aren't interested in their classmates' opinion because they believe its only the teacher's opinion that mattered.

> While interactions with staff still provided LPP, her negative identifications with peers undermined additional sources of support. [page 126]

> When she decided to move up to a Level 4 economics class with less scaffolding on writing assignments, she actively sought out peer feedback to meet these new literacy demands. She also complained that her Creative Writing class never included peer workshops. When I pointed out that she typically ignored peer feedback in UB, she responded, "I trust the kids in my class more than I did at UB because I'm closer to them, and they don't act like they are know-it-alls." [page 126]

> Ariel's experiences highlight how a student's sense of belonging within an academic community can impact her membership. Importantly, this sense of belonging often hinges upon identifications with peers and the ability to influence group practices. [page 126]

> As Wegner (1998) has observed, learning transforms identities, but difficulties reconciling multiple memberships limited Jared and Ariel's transformative potential. [page 127]

> both participants still followed their own trajectories due to the tensions between institutional power and individual agency. As Haneda (2006) has argued, CoP theory has under-conceptualized these dimensions, which poses a significant limitation for classroom research since LMs often grapple with hegemony and cultural conflict. [page 127]

> Toohey (1996) has shown how physical configurations within elementary classrooms limited LMs' agency and access to LPP. [page 127]

> both Morita (2004) and Norton (2001) have illustrated how adult multilingual students engaged in acts of subversion, such as nonparticipation, to maintain their agency in the face of hegemonic academic communities. [page 127]

Could this explain some LM students' dropping out?

> the current study has shown how institutional power mitigated the agency provided within pre-college outreach programs. Mixed ability grouping in UB showed Jared that minority students could excel with academic writing, but he was not always able to transfer these practices. While Ariel initially experienced a similar transformation in UB, white privilege in her high school later caused her to adopt an identity of nonparticipation in the program. [page 127]

> the current study shows how practices in these individual communities are inextricably bound to broader networks, or what Wegner (1998) has termed "constellations." Haneda (2006) has argued that researchers should distinguish participation from learning, since social interactions in an academic community are not the same thing as disciplinary knowledge. However, the broader perspective employed in this study questions whether such factors can be separated among adolescent learners, whose peer relationships and identities remain integral to disciplinary learning. [page 127]

> the transition from high school to college provides an opportunity to reshape identities by joining new academic communities. [page 127]

> Unfortunately, writing programs may perpetuate the negative labels students encounter in secondary schools by using placement practices that segregate LMs into developmental or ESL courses (Costino & Hyon, 2007; Harklau, Losey, & Siegal, 1999; Ortmeier-Hooper, 2008; Ruecker, 2011). Based on growing awareness of how these policies can affect LMs' identifies and tragectories, the *CCCC Statement on Second Language Writers and Writing* (2009) has called for multiple placement options, including mainstreaming ESL sections, and cross-cultural composition (which mixes student populations and makes linguistic diversity a topic of inquiry). Future research might compare the peer dynamics within these very different options in order to build stronger writing communities. [page 127--128]

> For Jared, the No Discount Policy and ceremony gave him the confidence he needed to change his writerly identity. However, he still stereotyped minority students in his high school, suggesting a need for greater critical awareness. [page 128]

> Ariel's dismissal of the No Discount Policy highlights the importance of helping students maintain agency while addressing ongoing conflicts. [page 128]

How does one help someone maintain agency? Give them choices?

> action research projects, such as those described in Gutiérrez's (2005) four-week summer program for migrants, can identify ways to blend community-building rituals, like the No Discount Policy, with reading, writing, and discussion activities to raise critical awareness. [page 128]
