Incomplete language acquisition results in poor academic performance [[@2021sailsman_esl#^56cf89]]. The reasons for this are varied, but it stands to reason if there is a significant language barrier, a student would not succeed in class. 

Even for a minor language barrier or difference in dialect, this can cause disruptive [[Linguistic minority students can feel isolated within the institution|feelings of isolation]] and otherness that can all affect academic performance. 

[[One can be proficient in a language for some situations but not others]]

It's important to note that [[Academic literacy for non-native speakers is estimated to take at least five years to truly master.]] and few if any language support programs last that long. It is certainly beyond the limits of most, if not all, financial aid.
