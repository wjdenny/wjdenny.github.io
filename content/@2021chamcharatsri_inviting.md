# Inviting Multilingual Students to Use Their First Language (L1) in Peer Review Activities: A Plurilingual Approach

## Notes
> [[Marshall and Moore (2018)]] argue that **plurilingualism "is more about individuals making choices and interacting in specific contexts and situations, including those where their agency is constrained"** (p. 23) (page 31)

> multilingual students can exercise their agency in choosing languages, and the choice is dependent on the contexts they are in. (page 31)

> Writing classrooms in which teachers employ plurilingual pedagogy will see that the **use of student L1s for collaborative activities like peer review allows for more engaged problem solving, encourages student agency, and supports language development.** (Readers interested in learning more about peer review might begin with [[2014 Ferris & Hedgcock|Ferris & Hedgcock, 2014]].) (page 31)

> **In a plurilingual approach, students are seen as agents who have freedom to utilize their linguistic repertoires** they bring into our classrooms. (page 32)

> Through the lens of plurilingual pedagogy, **students are empowered because they "engage collaboratively in real-life tasks that require [their] agency in strategically employing all resources available-- linguistic and nonlinguistic, implying a variety of languages and codes-- to solve a problem, to accomplish a mission**. ([[2018 Piccardo|Piccardo, 2018)]], p. 9). (page 32)

> **the pedagogical innovations that plurilingualism provides** in classrooms are 1) **the value of students linguistic repertoires**, 2) **the use of different languages as a mediated activity in the meaning-making process of lifelong learning** and, 3) **the learning process emerging from real-life activities through problem solving** ([[2018 Piccardo|Piccardo, 2018]]). (page 32)

> **preventing students from using their L1s in English learning contexts can be deterimental to their integration into an English-dominant society** ([[2000 Auerbach|Auerbach, 2000]]; [[2001 Cook|Cook, 2001]]; [[2020 Marshall|Marshall, 2020]]; [[2018 Marshall & Moore|Marshall & Moore, 2018]]). (page 32)

> The English-only approach operates on a belief that students would develop the English language skills faster if they do not use their L1s and only use the target language in classrooms ([[2000 Auerbach|Auerbach, 2000]]). (page 32)

> the belief that the use of students' L1s will slow down the acquisition of the English language; forbidding the L1 in the English classroom is thought to maximize students' use of English ([[1993 Auerbach|Auerbach, 1993]]; [[2017 Wang & Mansouri|Wang & Mansouri, 2017]]). (page 32--33)

> Recent developments of teaching methods like **communicative language teaching (CLT) and task-based approach (TBA) also operate under the assumption that students' use of L1s is not helpful in the development o the English language**; the CLT and TBA approaches attempts to minimize the use of L1s in classrooms ([[2001 Cook|Cook, 2001]]). (page 33)

> the language ideology has been promoted and sustained by teaching methods in which English language teachers do not recognize and/or realize that they have been exercising the promotion of a linguistic hierarchy in their classes. (page 33)

> teachers expect students who will be in their classrooms to possess a U.S.-based prestige variety of English. (page 33)

> their assumptions should be reexamined and addressed (page 33)

> writing teachers should ask students to identify whether they are English dominant, bilingual or multilingual students by a simple survey. (page 33)

> the risk of assigning unfitting identities to students ([[2008 Ortmeier-Hooper|Ortmeier-Hooper, 2008]]) (page 33)

> [[2016 Auerbach|Auerbach's (2016)]] reflection on her own 1993 publication about English only approaches in the classroom has confirmed that such ideological practice is not backed up by any evidence that students who use only English language in classrooms develop their language skills faster than those who use both English and their L1s in second language acquisition studies. (page 33)

> may give these students the message that their linguistic identities are not welcomed ([[2016 Auerbach|Auerbach, 2016]]). (page 33)

> **To limit or require students to use only the English language in the classroom is an act of violence or microaggression ([[2016 Auerbach|Auerbach, 2016]]), stripping away students' rights to use their languages as resources for learning** (page 33--34)

> **We need to understand that language learning process is a scaffolding activity in which a target language, the English language, is built on students' first languages** ([[2017 Piccardo|Piccardo, 2017]]). (page 34)

> we should invite students to use their L1.  (page 34)

> **use their L1s in writing classrooms in different activites such as brainstorming, drafting, and peer review activities and in differing linguistic contexts** (Antón & DiCamilla, 1998; Chamcharatsri, 2017; Storch & Wigglesworth, 2003; Villamil & Guerrero, 1996, 2006; Yu & Lee, 2014; Yu, Lee, & Mak, 2016).  (page 34)

> [[Storch & Wigglesworth (2003)]] asked research participants who have similar L1s to collaborate on two tasks: a text reconstruction task and a short join composition task ([[2003 Storch & Wigglesworth|Storch & Wigglesworth, 2003]]). Their participants used L1s to provide definitions of difficult lexicons and clarify English grammar structors and negotiate and divide assignments into smaller tasks. In general, students reported the method helpful. (page 34)

> two interesting **reasons that their participants decided not to use the L1s**: a) **using L1s would put them in a slower pace in class because they have to translate words in their L1s and back to English again**; and b) **they wanted to use English as much as possible "as a means of improving their English speaking skills"** ([[2003 Storch & Wigglesworth|Storch & Wigglesworth, 2003, p. 766]]).  (page 34)

> it is possible to encourage the use of the L1 with evidence-based pedagogical strategies (page 34)

> **L1 use has also been found to support collaborative writing tasks among Spanish as a Foreign Language students.** (page 34)

> **negotiate content, language issues, task mangement, and rapport building** ([[2012 DiCamilla & Antón|DiCamilla & Antón, 2012, p. 183]]) (page 34)

> participants used their L1 to help with metalinguistic functions such as finding appropriate word choice or working on challenging grammatical structures; the use of L1s also help create effective learning environments for the participants ([[2012 DiCamilla & Antón|DiCamilla & Anón, 2012, p. 183]]) (page 34)

> **My particpants reported that they had mixed feelings about using their L1s in providing written feedback on their peers' drafts "because many thought that they could only use the English language and because they faced the challenge of switching languages"** ([[2017 Chamcharatsri|Chamcharatsri, 2017, p. 69]]) (page 34)

> students thought that they had to use English in the U.S. classrooms (page 35)

> confirmed the benefit of using L1s in that they felt that it was easy to discuss and provide feedback in their L1s because the feedback they provided are more complicated without being hindered by the English language. (page 35)

> In an English as a foreign language (EFL) setting where the dominant language of the society is not English, [[2014 Yu & Lee|Yu and Lee (2014)]] investigated the use of L1 and L2 in peer-written feedback activity with 22 Chinese students. The results revealed that participants preferred to use L1 to "to give overall comments, provide suggestions, and summarize the problems" while L2 is used to provide feedback on form ([[2014 Yu & Lee|Yu & Lee, 2014, p. 31]]). (page 35)

> ([[2016 Yu, Lee, & Mak|Yu, Lee, & Mak, 2016]]). **In EFL settings it has been found that participants prefer to use L1 to give general comments and suggestions and to make the experience easier and more "efficient"** ([[2016 Yu, Lee, & Mak|Yu, Lee, & Mak, 2016, p. 4]]). (page 35)

> Though the number of research studies in this area is limited at this point, we can see that **the use of L1 in peer feedback activities can be beneficial to our students.** (page 35)

> "the recognition of the plurilingual nature of classroom interactions and communicative repertoires of both learners and teachers in multilingual settings, and **the affirmation of plurilingualism as a potential resource rather than necessarily a barrier to language and content learning"** ([[2013 Lin|Lin, 2013, p. 522]]). (page 35)

> I understand how it feels to have my name misprounounced. I translate my experience into my pedagogical belief that students' names are important, and I make sure to learn students' names and how they pronounce as soon as possible. On the first day of class, I usually start by doing a roll call. I ask my students to correct the pronunciation when/if I mispronounce their names. I also ask them to let me know if they have any preferred names that they would like me to use in this class. (page 36)

> Almost every semeseter, some students will ask me to use Anglicized names instead of their actual names. I usually ask them where they received the names from and whether they prefer their actual names or the Anglicized one. I respect student decisions on their names because I want them to feel welcome. (page 36)

> How many languages do they use in different contexts? In their English classes back in their home countries, are they allowed to use their first language in class? Why do they think they are (not) allowed to use the first language? In what ways do they think the English language is important? (page 36)

> I take some notes about their languages so that I can use this information to group students based on their linguistic resources. (page 36)

> **freewriting is one of many brainstorming activities ... many students ... have never heard of or encountered this activity and will be challenged by writing freely without stopping because they are taught to pay attention to grammatical constructions at the sentence level. In other words, writing without stopping and correcting their grammatical error contradicts what they have learned prior to coming to this class.** (page 37)

> **I also casually invite them to use their L1s if they cannot think of terms in the English language.** (page 37)

> many continue to write in English, some start to switch the language to their L1s. (page 37)

> we discuss students' experiences with peer reviews. Many students report that thye have never done peer review or that they had some experiences but did not enjoy or see the value in the peer review activities. (page 37)

> I asked whether they had trainings before conducting peer reviews in the past, many said that they had none. Some students also shared that they did not enjoy the peer review writing and they preferred teachers' feedback. (page 37)

> **research shows that students prefer teacher feedback particularly when their peers have no received proper training in providing peer feedback** ([[2019 Thirakunkovit & Chamcharatsri|Thirakunkovit & Chamcharatsri, 2019]]). (page 37)

> **students who have been properly trained can provide critical feedback to their peers' writing, which can be as helpful as feedback that are provided by teachers** ([[2019 Thirakunkovit & Chamcharatsri|Thirakunkovit & Chaamcharatsri, 2019, p. 160]]).  (page 37)

> Multiple resources in peer review training are available such as [[2014 Ferris & Hedgcock|Ferris and Hedgcock's (2014)]] *Teaching L2 Composition* or [[@2010lam_peer|Lam's (2010)]] article in which he has provided detailed step-by-step procedures and his reflections of the training materials. (page 37-38)

> with proper peer review training to students, they are more prepared to provide constructive feedback to their peers and become "conscientious writers who take responsibility for editing their own work" ([[@2010lam_peer|Lam, 2010, p. 124]]). (page 38)

>In the training, I start with either a one-page paper from my former student or a mock student paper that I have created. (page 38)

>  First, I ask students to provide feedback on the paper without giving a lot of instructions because I want to see what types of feedback they will provide in the paper. Many students start to provide explicit sentence level or grammatical feedback on their peers' papers. After students finish the activity, I ask them, "How would you feel if you receive this type of feedback on your papers?" and "Do you think this type of feedback is helpful if you plan to revise the paper?" Many students respond that they would feel judged and would be less motivated to revise their papers. (page 38)

> the purpose of peer review activities is to provide a reader's perspective on the paper. (page 38)

> not providing judgement but constructive feedback to help teh authors improve their papers. (page 38)

> I explain to them that grammatical feedback can be provided minimally because we will have peer editing sessions, with the focus on sentence-level issues, prior to turning in their final drafts. However, if the grammatical mistakes interefere with the meaning of the texts and cause confusions, they are allowed to provide the feedback now. (page 38)

 > Once they have finished the written feedback activity, the following step is crucial fo rchecking the students' understanding of the peer feedback activity; I ask students to read the written feedback that are given by their peers and share their reactions with the whole class. (page 39)
 
 > They often share that the questions provided by their peers help them see who they can revise their papers. (page 39)
 
 > another plurilingual strategy by intentionally grouping students who speak or share similar L1s in the same group. (page 39)
 
 > Then they ask me whether they may use their L1s in providing feedback on their peer's draft because I would not be able to understand what the comments will be about. I reassure them that they are allowed to use their L1s in providing feedback because I am not the person who has to read and revise the paper based on the written feedback; it's their peer who will reed and revise the paper. (page 39)
 
 What if only one student speaks their L1?

> Because we have another language as a resource, I feel that we should use it to our advantage. (page 40)

> they can communicate their ideas and feel that they can discuss their feedback easier in their L1 than in the English language ([[2017 Chamcharatsri|Chamcharatsri, 2017]]). (page 41)

> They also tell me that if they were to use English to provide both oral and written feedback, it would take them a longer time to come up with their responses. (page 41)

> some students feel that using their L1s cana lso be challenging because many concepts such as scientific names or language learning strategies that they have learned are in English, to translate those concepts to their L1s is a challenge to them. (page 41)

> By engaging students in plurilingual pedagogy, students will gain metalinguistic awareness between their L1s and the English language. [[Myhill (2011)]] defined metalingusitic awareness as the learners' abilities to consciously examine their languages and manipulate their resources to express their meanings based on the intended audience. (page 41)

Wouldn't they anyway, though? This just makes it easier for everyone by not trying to force them to use only English.

> teachers also felt uneasy to allow students to use their full linguistic resources in classrooms, as the teachers do not comprehend what the students discuss ([[2020 Bacon|Bacon, 2020]]). (page 42)

> By limiting students to use only English, the teachers limit or censor the right for students to fully engage in their learning. (page 42)

> one language can have multiple layers of local, regional, or society variations; language learning is a continual activity throughout our lives. (page 42)

> The many English speaking students who come to our classes with local, regional, or international Englishes should therefore be allowed to use their varieties of English such as African American English (AAE) ([[2021 Byrd & Brown|Byrd & Brown, 2021]]) or what some Latinx users of both Spanish and English call "Spanglish" ([[2005 Rothman & Rell|Rothman & Rell, 2005]]) in participating in-class activities, when it is appropriate. 

> [[2018 Marshall & Moore|Marshall and Moore (2018)]] have pointed out that plurilingual pedagogy helps students to "develop their voices and identities as newcomers to the academy" (p. 27). (page 42)

> If teachers would like to try this approach, one way is to find literary narratives that are written by mixing languages as one of the reading assignments. (page 42)

> [[2014 Kim & Yoon|Kim and Yoon (2014)]] conducted a study with Korean students who English proficiencies are at elementary, intermediate, and advanced levels of language proficiency. Across the board, students from all levels employed their L1s in the writing process in helping with generating and elaborating ideas. (page 42)

> [[2014 Kim & Yoon|Kim and Yoon (2014)]] also found that some students might translate directly from their L1s to the English language. (page 42)

> Teachers can invite students to use their L1s in drafting their speeches or brainstorming their papers. (page 42)

> Another context is corss-cultural classrooms in which students in classes are a combination of L1 and L2 users of English. A plurilingual approach will provide and opportunity for both L1 and L2 students to engage and laern from one another through their linguistic resources. L2 students have an opportunity to discuss different lexical items or sentence structures that cannot translated into English and their L1 peers can help figure out an appropriate word while learning the limitation of the English langauge in relation to other languages. (page 42--43)

> this can also be practiced in writing centers in which writing tutors and tutees use their L1s in tutoring sessions. (page 43)
