There are visual techniques that allow us to work *with* our audience members' brains instead of against it. [[The gestalt principles of visual perception are basic design principles that describe how audiences read visual information like charts]] Dealing with  [[Preattentive attributes are an easily noticeable difference in appearance useful for both quantitative and qualitative data]]

### Audience perception follows a few basic rules, with some caveats
[[Complex visual inputs are normally processed in a zig-zag pattern, starting with the upper left, moving to the right, then down to the bottom left, and to the right]] 

[[The more visual detail presented on the screen, the more likely your audience will experience cognitive overload and tune out]] Some types of charts or common design strategies violate this principle, so care must be taken in their design.

[[Design choices should be made deliberately]] This is even more important when data visuals are made by our software using default settings. Be explicit.
