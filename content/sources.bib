However, the issue of academic dishonesty among international students is complex and difficult. This study investigated the perceptions of international undergraduate and graduate students in a southern U.S. university about possible causes for academic misbehavior. Results reveal several causal variables: previous learning style, English language proficiency, unfamiliarity with American academic cultures, relationship between student and teacher, and availability of technical and educational resources associated with academic dishonesty.},

# How to turn your notes into published articles and books using the Obsidian app with Eleanor Konik

- [[Linking Your Thinking]] posted this video on [[YouTube]]. It is an interview between [[Nick Milo]] and [[Eleanor Konik]].

## Notes
I still don't like importing notes from reading apps. First, because I don't use them. Second, because I feel like manually reviewing those notes and linking them to projects or topic areas that are relevant helps me stay focused on action. But, folks like [[Eleanor Konik]] undoubtedly produce a lot of work while using that method of dumping notes from their reading app. Am I just slowing myself down? I can experiment with this, but I need to find [[PDF and EPUB reading apps]] that allow me to export highlights and annotations to text. [[One needs to be more thoughtful about what notes we take when there is more friction to storing it in our system]]

[[Capture notes widely and use a discovery process to find notes on specific topics]]

She uses backlinks to organize notes into task lists, but I prefer to [[Use tags instead of backlinks to organize notes into task lists]]

[[Use Obsidian and Dataview to track the status of multiple articles]]

She avoids links to uncreated pages to reduce the impact of multiple pages of similarly named notes. When she's ready to make the page, she uses aliases to pull it all together. At least that's what I took from it; I think I misunderstood it though, because aliases don't work quite like that. They really only benefit us as an autocomplete suggestion and backlinks.

[[Use a phone's speech to text features on Obsidian Mobile to capture stream of consciousness thoughts]]
