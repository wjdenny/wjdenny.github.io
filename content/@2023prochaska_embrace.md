# Embrace the Bot: Designing Writing Assignments in the Face of AI
- [[Eric Prochaska]] wrote this article for [[Faculty Focus]].

> [!summary] Summary
> Working with AI is a useful skill for students to learn.

## Notes
> The better question is, even in the era of AI, how can we best teach our students?

> For instructors who evaluate to help students develop their writing skills, it would be a waste of time to respond to anything their students did not write – and these students would have little invested in reviewing the feedback.

AI-generated writing is a misuse of an instructor's time.

> caveat: In over ten years of teaching freshman English, I learned that the more I policed student work, the less energy I had to be a good teacher. Be prudent in how much effort you devote to this strategy.

> In-class writing

In-class writing is one form of writing assessment that removes the possibility of cheating with AI.

> Writing alternatives. Assign visual organizers or other assignments instead of papers.

Using visual organizers, presentations, and other non-writing forms of assessment are ways to avoid the possibility of cheating with AI.

> (guest speakers, peer presentations, field trips, in-class debates, etc.), of which the AI is not aware. If you require students to include unique and specific knowledge in their writing, AI has little chance of including the content you require.

Focusing writing assignments on information specific to the class, such as presentations, guest speakers, or field trips, are one way of making it harder to use AI to generate writing.

> Writing based on human experience. Assign writing that relies on student perspective, experience, and cultural capital. This approach aligns with a diversity, equity, and inclusion model of designing writing assignments that could result in the most meaningful analysis and synthesis of information. The instructor is just as likely to learn from their students’ work as the students are.

AI has a harder time generating text with a personal perspective or about personal experiences

> One underlying premise here is that AI will not produce texts with resonant personal perspective; but even if AI can replicate this type of writing, a second premise is that a writing assignment that invites students to share the ways in which their lives intersect with academia will motivate students to write their own papers.

Even if AI can generate realistic texts on personal experience topics, students will be more motivated to do the writing themselves as opposed to writing on topics less interesting to them.

> “if you can’t beat them, join them” approach, in which instructors embrace the reality of AI-written content and work with their students to demystify and deconstruct the textual artifacts AI produces. This approach is best suited to classes that have ample time to perform a rhetorical analysis of AI writing and the expectations and assessments of writing assignments.

Using AI-generated text in assignments or in the classroom is  a way of avoiding cheating with AI. It focuses more on building an awareness of AI abilities and developing useful skills in interacting with AI. 

> AI may encourage a brave new exploration of higher-order thinking skills. There are surely larger conversations to have about the role of composition courses in higher education—and of assessments in all courses—but the argument can be made that AI is a tool and students who learn to use that tool are learning a valuable skill.
