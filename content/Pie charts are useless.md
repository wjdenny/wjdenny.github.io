If I remember anything from this book, it will be that pie charts are useless. For two reasons:
- For 2 categories (or, god forbid, less) a sentence works just as well
- For more than 2 categories, 
	- bar charts are easier to read because humans can grasp length better than area, and
	- tables, if not too long or wide, can do the job, too.
