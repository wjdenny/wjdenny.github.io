Use tags instead of backlinks to organize notes into task lists.

[[Eleanor Konik]] uses links in her notes to things like `[[Todo List]]` or `[[Article & Blog Ideas]]` to use the backlinks in those pages as a sort of gathering point for ideas and tasks. When it is finished, she removes the link from the note. She wants to move away from this, though.

So what's the difference between using a link like ``Article Ideas`` and using a tag like `#ideas/articles`? [[Links, tags, and folders have different uses]] According to [[@2021wilson_links]], tags would fit this need the best among the two options, as it functions mainly as a saved search. To that point, a backlink would generate a bit of waste; it generates a file on the system. It also requires that the link be made somewhere within the note itself; whereas a tag can be used in the metadata. This makes it easier to manipulate those files (since tools already exist that can strip YAML metadata headers from files) without the extra metadata embedded within the note.
