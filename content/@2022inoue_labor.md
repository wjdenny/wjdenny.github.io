## Notes
### Forward to the Second Edition: Antiblackness and the Use of the N-word in Academia

This is how you come back from making a mistake,

> Thus, through this languaging, I have participated in antiblackness. [page ix]

> In their introduction to *Antiblackness*, João H. Costa Vargas and Moon-Ke Jung explain that racism is not the same as antiblackness. To explain the difference, they say that “[a] world without racism requires deep transformations in social practices and structures. A world without antiblackness necessitates an entirely new conception of the social, which is to say a radically different world altogether" (7). Thus racism is primarily a set of structural conditions that create various kinds of oppression and inequality. It is dismantled in policies, practices, and procedures in classrooms, institutions, and other settings. While antiblackness can be found in the structural, in our conditions, it is also a deeply embedded part of how everyone is asked to be oriented in the world, how we all come to orient ourselves in the world, how we come to understand what is human and its opposite, what is inhuman. In another important sense, antiblackness is a part of Althusserian interpellation that constitutes each of us, the hails that make us who we think we are, that call us to be and act in the world in the ways we do, and understand ourselves and others in particular ways, ways that usually feel “normal" or “natural" to us. [page x--xi]

> This new conception of the social that Vargas and Jung speak of references the ways that throughout history, particularly in the very influential Western European world, Blackness has been a key way to define good and bad, right and wrong, human and inhuman, and consequently to define various kinds of people. [page xi]

> didn't gain purchase until the Enlightenment (the 17th and 18th centuries) ... some historians have argued that race was more than nascent in earlier periods. (page xi)

> early concepts of Blackness linked to Ethiopians go back to Homer, in which the original term, "*Αἰθίοψ (Aithiops*/Ethiopians) derives from two Greek words: *αἴθω* (*aithō*, "I burn") + *ὤψ* (*ōps* "face") (43). (page xii)

> Chenault concludes that Aristotle's concept of "natural slaves" and the Greek concept of *Aithiops*/Ethiopians was important to later notions of Blackness that yoked Blackness to slave as a natural condition and even an inhuman one. (page xii)

Frank B. Wilderson quoting Orlando Patterson:
> > To put it differently, the violence which both elaborates and saturates Black "life" is totalizing, so much so as to make narrative inaccessible to Blacks. This is not a problem for Black people. It is a problem for the organizational calculus (Spillers 2003) of the Humanities writ large. (Wilderson n.p). (page xiii)

> According to Wilderson's Afropessimism, to be Black today, as it has been throughout history, is to be inextricably bound to the category of slave, that is a category that equates to "social death." (page xiii)

> In Wilderson's view, 'people of color'-- a term he uses for those who are neither white nor Black-- are 'junior partners' to whites in the enslavement of Blacks" (n.p). This centrality of Blackness is critical to how society orients itself, how people orient themselves, how we all in some way get interpellated as white, Black, brown, Asian, Latinx, etc. Antiblackness is the orientation that makes not just whiteness and white supremacy, but all orientations that might be cast as human, since the human is also defined by the nonhuman or inhuman. (page xiii)

> As Vargas and Jung explain, "Since the dawn of modernity, Black people have been progressively, singularly positioned-- materially and symbolically-- as the 'slave race' around the globe" (4). (page xiii--xiv)

> Ross explains, 
> 
> > Anti-blackness describes the inability to recognize black humanity. It captures the reality that the kind of violence that saturates black life is not based on any specific thing a black person-- better described as "a person who has been racialized black"-- did. The violence we experience isn't tied to any particular transgression. It's gratuitous and unrelenting (n.p)
> (page xiv)

> This is the premise that Robin DiAngelo begins with in her chapter on antiblackness (91). She further explains the ways antiblackness leads many white people to feel white guilt (95). Drawing on Carol Anderson's important work on the subject, antiblackness also leads many white(ly) people to "white rage" (DiAngelo 96). DiAngelo ends with a list of white fragile behaviors that result. All of these behaviors are a reaction to seeing, feeling, and understanding our antiblackness as a condition that we each must continually confront and hopefully dismantle in humble and compassionate ways. (page xiv)

Quoting a letter from a student group published in The Standford Daily,
>> To draw on the words of Toni Morrison '75, "[t]he function, the very serious function of racism is distraction. It keeps you from doing your work. It keeps you explaining, over and over again, your reason for being." [...] Black personhood is sacrificed so that others are enlightened. This makes it clear whom these courses are really meant to serve. 
>
> (page xviii)

> Being a writing teacher, performing that role in a university or college, means not being a writing teacher as much as being a *whiting teacher* whose duty it is to whiten all students with standardized English, bleaching tongues, rooting out Blackness without naming it. I've had this critique before, but I've not always realized just how much it depends on understanding antiblackness as a deep part of the colonial project of the college language classroom. (page xix)

> In our world, to promote a standardized English and a dominant whitely set of language habits, for whatever reason, means also that we set ourselves against Blackness and Black languaging. Most of us likely never realize that we orient ourselves and our language teaching projects as antiblack. We just turn away from Blackness and toward whiteness, white habits of language, all of which promote white language supremacy. (page xix)

> the Scottish poet Robert Burns used it in a 1786 poem titled, "The Ordination," which yokes the word to the descendants of the Biblical character of Ham, a negative association (10). In many Christian traditions, Ham, is the epitome of the marked body, the slave body. Thus the "curse of Ham" became the way many Christians, particularly in the US during legalized slavery, justified enslavement of Black people (Rae n.p). It was a part of God's Will. [page xxii]

> [[Vershawn A. Young]] [...]
> > To forbid the N-word actually serves the purpose of white supremacy and resuscitates racism rather than defeat it. [...] ("Banning" n.p.) [page xxii]

> The six or seven ways the word is used in Black culture is a reference to Gloria Naylor's 1986 *New York Times* essay, "What's In A Name?" (reproduced as "The Meanings of a Word"). [page xxiii]

> Whiteness is the yardstick of value. How close are you to the white subject, to white languages, etc.? This tells a body of color how "good" they are, how "beautiful" they are understood to be in the world, and so on. It also suggests how "appropriate" or "clear" or "effective" your languaging is. [page xxiii]

> While there is no universal definition for "hate speech," the United Nations does offer this one:
> 
> > any kind of communication in speech, writing or behavior, that attacks or uses pejorative or discriminatory language with reference to a person or group on the basis of who they are, in other words, based on their religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, colour, descent, gender or other identity factor. (United Nations n.p.) [page xxiv--xxv]

> Black English is not owned by Black identified groups either, even if it is closely associated with those groups. Non-Black identified people, such as Emenim, speak, and use Black English all the time, just as I have in my life because of where I grew up. And yet, I cannot deny that Black English is a product of Blackness, Black culture, Black people, their struggles, conditions, and ways with words. I also cannot deny that the N-word isn't just any old word. [page xxix]

> I neglected Alim and Smitherman's point that they make about such Black English languaging in their book, *Articulate While Black*. Quoting Arthur Spears, they ask about Black speech more generally: "On what basis is speech to be judged negative, position, or neutral? On whose norms is such an evaluation based?" (124). [page xxx]

> They explain that because of the "broader context of the marginalization of Black people, it is difficult for Blacks to see genuine, well-intentioned White participation [in Black languaging] as a nonthreatening sign of cultural appreciation" (125). Ultimately, Alim and Smitherman say that "Black communication **becomes** controversial only in a society that deprecates Blackness" (125). [page xxx]

> [[Vershawn A. Young|Vershawn Young]] explains that such uses are a part of "nigga-gender," which is a hypermasculinity designed to protect the Black body. It's a masculinity that is opposed to the racialized gendered performance that Black male academics, such as Young, often have to perform in order to survive such places (Young, *Your Average* 62). [page xxxiii]

> I wanted to shock white readers with the N-word, but as the Stanford students explain, this rhetorical strategy is thinking about how to enlighten white readers at the cost of Black ones. It participates in antiblackness. It is not ethical;. It does not practice Black compassion, that is, compassion for Black readers who are more likely to be harmed in such discussions. [page xxxiii]

> To call of Kay's framing of the word (153-155), there are many other "complication relationships" to the N-word than just white relations and Black relations to it. [page xxxiv]

> [[Catherine Prendergast]] called out in her [[1998 Prendergast|1998 article, "Race: The Absent Presence in Composition Studies."]] ... Prendergast explains: "Instead race becomes subsumed into powerful topes of 'basic writer,' 'stranger' to the academy, or the trope of the generalized, marginalized 'other'" (36). [page xxxiv]

> I'm more interested, however, in the way Kennedy cannot escape the white vs Black binary in these theories, which like most of the scholarship on the N-word leaves academic of color like me out of the discussion. [page xxxv]

What about Jaime in Broad City, confessing to Lincoln about calling his pet turtle the N-word?

> I have never been white, not by society's standards, not by the standards of any school I've ever attended or worked at. I too have experienced lots of racism and racial slurs directed straight at me. An entire generation of my tribe in the US was imprisoned unlawfully, stripped of their worldly belongings, had their homes and property stolen by whites, their entire livelihoods taken away in a day, a full generation of wealth and property gone. I have been called many ugly and harmful names. I've been mistreated by neighbors and teachers in ugly, hurtful, and racist ways. I too bear racist trauma in my body. My trauma is not made from slavery, nor the N-word, but it is racial trauma by the hands of white settler colonial institutions and people. [page xxxvi]

> Japanese immigrants too came to the US as settlers, settling on land of indigenous peoples, particularly in the West. We've been a part of settler colonialism that has harmed Native American groups, taken from their lands, even if those lands were later taken from us. We too have been party to indigenous injustice and oppression. No one gets to claim unsullied hands in global racism, settler colonialism, or antiblackness. [page xxxvi]

> As Neider reminded me on several occasions, because of our history in the US, Black people always get "punched down" upon. While there are arguments against framing the problems of racism as who is "punching up" or "punching down" (Morenoff), I hear Neider making a different point about this. Saying that Black people are always "punched down" upon underscores a racial hierarchy of hurt operating tacitly in the US and likely everywhere. [page xxxvii]

> If there are to be negative consequences in a system, context, classroom, or place, Black people are most likely to attract those negative consequences. If hurt is to be had, Black people are likely to get it. The negative consequences are mostly or more negative to Black people. This means that I, an Asian American scholar, sit at a different place in this racial hierarchy of hurt. This is also why Asian racist slurs are apples to the N-word's oranges in Asim's comparison. [page xxxvii]

This might have something to do with why there are more Black students in ELA courses than other racial groups.

> The white vs. Black binary framing of the discussion in the scholarship of the N-word, beyond ignoring other racial subjectivities, in my case participates in the Asian-as-perpetual-foreigner of "Asian American Otherness" narratives that have persisted in the US (Lee, Orientals 3: Yamamoto 5). These narratives relegate Asian Americans to perpetual outsider status. If we are always understood as foreigners, then of course, we are excluded from such quintessentially "American" discussions as who can say the N-word. Asian people like me are not in the discussions in the scholarship because I'm not "in" America in the ways that white and Black citizens are. Just as white and Black racial subjectivities form most of the discussions of students and racial issues in national conversations, white vs. Black subjects are at the center of the scholarship on and discussions of the N-word. [page xxxvii--xxxviii]

> not being white ain't being Black. [page xxxviii]

> Many of these perpetual foreigner narratives began with other narratives, such as those around Asians as a "yellow peril," which launched numerous anti-Asian laws and policies in the US like the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and "foreign miner's taxes" (Lee, *The Making*90-91; Lee, *Orientals*, 137). The legal scholar and professor Angelo Ancheta, offers a history of anti-Asian laws and court decisions that reveal the evolving ways the Asian people of all kinds have been legally understood as "unwelcome immigrant," "foreigner," or "illegal alien" in the US (11; see also Lee, *Orientals* 3). Most know about the racist government actions against Japanese during World War II, but fewer people are aware of the "Tacoma Method," named after an incident in 1885, when 800 to 900 Chinese residents of Tacoma, Washington, the state in which the antiracist project was being conducted, were forced out of the city on foot, their homes and businesses looted and destroyed, by an armed mob of white residents (Lee, *The Making* 94; Lee, *America* 104). [page xxxviii]

[[The Tacoma Method was an episode of anti-Chinese ethnic cleansing that occured in Tacoma, Washington in 1885]]

> Even the recently lauded film, *Crazy Rich Asians* (2018) based on the novel by Kevin Kwan sets the all Asian cast in Singapore, so Asians are understood as not American, but primarily from and of somewhere else. Mostly though, assimilation means that a white man marries an Asian woman. [...] Asian men remain, even in these narratives, on the sidelines, outsiders, not really a part of the conversation about who is American. [page xxxix]

> Perhaps our version of antiblackness is *Asian exclusionism*, an orientation that ignores or turns away from Asian identified people, that places us in perpetual outsider status, and leaves us out of conversations in which we too have a stake. We are not inhuman as antiblackness identifies the way the Black category is defined, rather we are *exohuman* outside of the (white) human category, or maybe phase-shifted a step or two. We are undiscussed. [page xxxix]

> But what I see now is that this amounts to caring more for white readers than Black, Latinx, indigenous , or even Asian readers. To further complication this, every year I am internet stalked, doxxed, and threatened by right-wing and other news media and individuals [...] I use a detective at ASU who checks all tweets, emails, Facebook posts, and phone messages that I get that even hint at being threatening. [...] I'm also on right-wing "watch lists" and websites that list who those sites consider dangerous educators. [page xl--xli]

> While I was trying hard to write for a diverse antiracist writing teacher audience, my default audience in my head was a white audience. [page xliii]

> The academy is a racial hierarchy of hurt where Black scholars and readers always get traumatized. This is what Thomas and Neider were telling me. This is what the Black Stanford students tell us all. [page xliv]

> The impulse to cancel someone seems to me so driven by correcting and condemning the wrong-doer, who does need correcting, but in the process shames and ostracizes them to the point of fomenting bitterness, sewing seeds of further distrust and maybe even hatred. It lets our traumas and anger consume all of us, consume the traumatized and the traumatizer. It often also separates the individual offender from the spaces in which they might learn more about their antiblackness, and do future good work together.
> So instead of recruiting more allies and co-conspirators, cancel culture can too often drive people away from the social justice movements they may actually wish to be a part of, the movements we all need to be a part of, not apart from. What cancel culture doesn't end up doing is making more socially just conditions. It makes conditions that resist dialogue and discussion about difficult topics like racism and antiblackness. [...] Instead of a "cancel culture," I think we might think of our classrooms and other spaces as "*compassion cultures,"* [page xlv]

### Introduction: Laboring Toward Grading Contracts and the Inner Dikes
> designing fair and meaningful grading practices is about cultivating with our students an ecology, a place where every student, no matter where they come from or how they speak or write, can have access to the entire range of final course grades possible. [page 3]

> While the qualities of student writing is still at the center of the classroom and feedback, it has no bearing on the course grade. [page 3]

> Because all grading and assessment exist within systems that uphold singular, dominant standards that are racist, and white supremacist when used uniformly. [page 3]

[[Inoue's labor-based grading contracts hold writing quality central to the course without affecting the final grade]]
[[People who have the most access to privilege benefit the most from monolingual ideologies]]

If I understand well, the point is that the use of a *single* standard in an institution where one racial group has the majority of the power is bound to be racist in practice if not in design. If we allow multiple standards, or to the other extreme, to allow students to set their own standards, it would undermine this. However, it would also undermine the faith that people outside of the college put in the degree as students could set any standard they wish. Somewhere between the two would be ideal. For teachers to have the training and time needed to work with students individually on specific goals and standards for themselves. This approaches the support model of university ESL interventions. I wish I knew how to find the colleges that do this. 

> It turns out that engaging with diverse ways of languaging and judging in the right kinds of assessment ecologies offers flexible and critical rhetorical training that can prepare students for a wide variety of communication situations. [page 4]

It's passages like these that make me realize this is referring to students of first year composition courses and not pre-college ESL/EAP that I teach. It still has value for me in that it sets my teaching in a wider university context. Maybe I can follow up with [[Asao Inoue]] one day and ask his thoughts on how to apply this in ESL/EAP?

> It is often believed falsely that grading is just an institutional necessity, something we can ask students to ignore, at least while they are learning. But to attempt to do that is to ignore the way grades work in classrooms, how they shape many aspects of the entire ecology, how they influence students' and teachers' actions. Not thinking of assessment first, or at least simultaneously with pedagogy, is a mistake. And our students who do not already come to us embodying a dominant English will pay for it, even when our intentions are to help those very students. [page 4]

> makes the means of grading also its ends. [...] the means, our processes of laboring, are all we have and all our students can have for their learning. [page 4]

[[Labor-based grading practices link assessment with pedagogy making them one in the same]]

> Grading, because it requires a single, dominant standard, is a racist and white supremacist practice. [page 5]

> Grading is almost always employed in order to control students. [...] force students to be accountable [...] and measure or rank students [...] either against each other or against a single standard. Each of these purposes for grading in writing classrooms is detrimental to learning generally, and more harmful to many students of color and raciolinguistically diverse students. [page 5]

> *habitus* (or linguistic, bodily, and performative dispositions)

[[The habitus discussed by Inoue is a style of communication that is adopted by a person to mark them as belonging to a particular group]]

>disposition to be calm and rational is a part of the academic dispositions that [[2006 Thaiss & Zawacki|Thaiss and Zawacki]] contend, in their interdisciplinary study of writers, may be universal in all academic writing (5-6). This disposition also is deeply rooted in a white racial *habitus*. [...] To see how the literature on whiteness has identified the disposition of reason and neutrality, see [[1997 Brookhiser|Brookhiser]], [[2002 Myser|Myser]], and [[1982 McGill & Pearce|McGill and Pearce]]. [page 6]

Is this related to the way I feel about working in a restaurant vs. college? Anger and passion is not welcome in the white collar world. This might also be even more specifically a white *cishet male* habitus, and is also widely adopted in the capitalist business world. It makes sense, as WASP types did and do not often work in food service.

> Staying a while in your discomfort that my use throughout this book of the terms "white language supremacy" and "white supremacy" bring is an important part of a critical, [[Paolo Freire|Freirean]], problematizing practice that I'll discuss in Chapter 1. [page 6]

I want to re-start [[Critical ESL Reading Group|a critical reading pedagogy group]] with my colleagues.

> Critical Race Theory (CRT), which discuss counter storytelling as important to disrupting white supremacist and racist narratives that become naturalized in institutions and society as normative, often non-racial, and neutral (Solórzano and Yosso "[[2001 Solórzano & Yosso|Critical Race and LatCrit]]"; "[[2002b Solórzano & Yosso|Critical Race Methodology]]"; "[[2002a Solórzano & Yosso|Critical Race Counterstory]]"). [page 6]

> As Chapter 6 will discuss, compassion is an important part to my labor-based grading contracts because it is an important way that my students and I set ground rules for the difficult conversations about language, race, racism, whiteness, and white language supremacy we have. [page 7]

I don't expect I'll be having much of these conversations in my level 2 ELA classes, but I still think they should inform how I assess students.

I imagine someone might argue that some students still don't acquire the language well enough even if they work very hard and do everything in the course. At this point, I would say that for those students, there's no evidence that *any* amount of ELA will help them achieve that goal. And since we are a community college, we cannot exclude students based on academic performance. (I should fact-check that first, though.) I see giving that student a failing grade an indirect method of excluding students from the college based on academic performance.

> Drawing on [[Peggy McIntosh]] and others, [[Derald Wing Sue|[Derald Wing] Sue]] explains that white privilege is a set of "unearned advantages and benefits that accrue to white folks by virtue of a system normed on the experiences, values, and perceptions of their group"; furthermore, these invisible privileges are "premised on the mistaken notion of individual meritocracy and deservingness (hard work, family values, etc.) rather than favoritism . . . [and are] deeply embedded in the structural, systemic, and cultural workings of U.S. society" ([[2003 Sue|*Overcoming* 137]]). These advantages and benefits are automatically conferred, such as using a standard for writing in a course in which some students have considerably more contact with it outside of the course (or school) than others. These students' good grades seem to be due simply to hard work and merit, but this is only so because their white racial *habitus* and the *habitus* that informs the standard for good writing agree with one another.
> 
> [[Derald Wing Sue|Sue]] explains that white privilege needs white supremacy as a system to exist at all. 
> 
> > White supremacy is a doctrine of racial superiority that justifies discrimination, segregation, and domination of persons of color based on an ideology and belief system that considers all other non-white groups inferior ([[1997 Jones|J. M. Jones, 1997]]) . . . it resides in the very institutional and cultural foundation of our society . . . To maintain conformance and silence of persons of color, white supremacy as a doctrine and belief is instilled through education and enforced by biased institutional policies or practices that punish those who dare raise their voices in objection to their second-class status ([[2015 Sue|*Race Talk* 155]])
> 
> [page 7--8]

> Sue quotes [[James M. Jones|[James M.] Jones]], saying that institutional racism-- and so white supremacy-- are "those established laws, customs, and practices which systematically reflect and produce racial inequalities in American society," and these customs, laws, and practices are what Sue identifies as our "standard operating procedures" or SOPs ([[2015 Sue|Sue, *Race Talk* 90]]). [page 8]

> the privileges that a white racial *habitus* confer in classrooms where language is graded by a single standard gives some unearned privileges, yet those standards are a part of our SOPs in school. [page 8]

Not as much inside my class, but it is the reason my class exists. Well, it still gives unearned privileges because students who went to a university in their home country still had access to a white habitus, and even if their parents went to university.

> "If racist consequences accrue to institutional laws, customs, or practices, the institution is racist whether or not the individuals maintaining those practices have racist intentions" ([[1997 Jones|Jones 438]]; qtd. in [[2015 Sue|Sue, *Race Talk* 90]]).

> White Supremacy is a product or effect of systems and structures, our SOPs (standard operating procedures), despite anyone's intentions, that produce political, cultural, linguistic, and economic dominance for white people. This means that white language supremacy can be defined as a product of effect of assessment systems and structures, our SOPs in classrooms and other places where language is judged, despite anyone's intentions, that produce political, cultural, linguistic, and economic dominance for white people. The use of labor-based grading contracts, I believe, changes the rules of the grading game in such as way that white language supremacy can not only be seen for what it is, but effectively countered. This makes for a fairer, more equitable, and inclusive language classroom. [page 8--9]

> While linguistics and other scholars agree that there is no single way to communicate effectively, judgements of effectiveness and correctness of language are contingent and contextual. What this really says in a U.S. educational context is that effectiveness and correctness of language is racialized. It has come from white racialized groups in our histories ([[1995 Ignatiev|Ignatiev]]; [[1998 Jacobson|Jacobson]]; [[2007 Roediger|Roediger]]). White people and whiteness as a set of raciolinguistic dispositions and habits, or white *habitus*, and the context and contingency for effectiveness or "goodness," or appropriateness, or excellence. [page 9]

To people saying we help students by not letting them waste money by taking mainstream classes and failing; then why only do it for non-native speakers? Why were they singled out for this paternalistic policy?

> [[Cheryl L. Harris]]' comprehensive legal account of the ways that laws and the courts in the US defined and maintained whiteness as property extends to education and literacy, particularly as seen in the *Brown v. Board of Education* decisions ([[1984 Brown v. Board of Education|1984]] and [[1955 Brown v. Board of Education|1955]]), which were an extension of the *Plessy v. Ferguson* decision ([[1896 Plessy v. Ferguson|1896]]) ([[1993 Harris|Harris 1746-57]]). These judicial decisions hinge on questions of whiteness as property. Harris explains in her conclusion about the Brown decisions:
> 
> > Whiteness as property continues to perpetuate racial subordination through the courts'' definitions of group identity and through the courts' discourse and doctrine on affirmative action. The exclusion of subordinated "others" was an remains a central part of the property interest in whiteness and, indeed, is part of the protection that the court extends to whites' settled expectations of continued privilege ([[1993 Harris|1758]]). 
> 
> [page 9--10]

> What [[Cheryl L. Harris|Harris]] shows in her discussion over and over in various legal ways and through court decisions in various realms of U.S. society is the way whiteness has functioned and been used as property for the benefit of those deemed to be racially white. Whiteness is the property that even a poor, uneducated, or jobless white man can have that has value. Furthermore, Harris argues that "Whiteness and property" share a common premise--a conceptual nucleus--of a right to exclude" ([[1993 Harris|1704]]). Whiteness as property is, therefore, about exclusion. This point is critical in educational settings because most of us proclaim or promote inclusion. Our schools, programs, and even pedagogies proclaim to include raciolinguistically diverse students, but our grading practices, standards, and assumptions function to exclude. And the direction this exclusion takes is a racialized one. [page 10]

[[Harris argues that whiteness is property, legally speaking, and like all property, grants its possessor the right to exclude]]
[[Many DEI initiatives in higher education fail to be inclusive when it comes to academic policies and grading, reducing those initiatives merely to diversity theatre]]

> In [[2003 Prendergast|*Literacy and Racial Justice: The Politics of Learning After* Brown v. Board of Education]], [[Catherine Prendergast]] argues convincingly that historically in the US the courts have worked from a fundamental premise that "literacy is first and foremost white property," and the logic goes "that no attempt should therefore be made to redistribute the best goods" ([[2003 Prendergast|167]]). She looks closely at the logics and consequences of [[1976 Brown v. Board, Washington v. Davis|*Brown v. Board, Washington v. Davis* (1976)]], and [[1978 The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke|*The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke* (1978)]], all of which demonstrate what Prendergast calls "the economy of literacy as a white property," or a dynamic rooted in figurative or literal "white flight" in places where people of color begin to accumulate. She explains the dynamic: "literacy standards are perceived to be falling or in peril of falling" when too many people of color, often African-American, are included or presence in the place in question, be it a school, police department, community, etc. ([[2003 Prendergast|41]]). Where do we find the most calls around "literacy crises"? Schools and communities that are made up of increasing numbers of people of color. What do schools and classrooms have at their disposal to remedy such perceptions of falling literacy standards among their students? Grading mechanisms and standards. Remember the primary goals of trading by a standard are control, enforced accountability, and measurement. Thus, grading is a great way to protect the white property of literacy in schools, while never mentioning race. It's a great way to maintain the white supremacist status quo without ever being white supremacist, yet such standards are white language supremacy. [page 10]

[[Literacy is white property and grading is used to exclude non-white bodies from its use]]

> So if literacy has been, and continues to be, a white property in the US, and if the nature of white property is the right to exclude, and if grading by a standard is always about control, accountability, and measurement, the grading by a single standard is how most, if not all, schools and writing classrooms exercise the historical right to exclude in order to protect literacy as white property, all the while exclaiming and even believing that they are helping their students of color. [page 10--11]

> in all schools, grades are the means of discrimination, the methods of exclusion, not inclusion, no matter what else we may think they do for our students. [page 11]

This is what I want to explore in the data with the [[Data Analysis Project]]. Native students who enroll vs. non-native speaker students who enroll; how does their graduate and transfer rate compare? how does the number of years they took to graduate compare? From there, I can also estimate the cost of the degree and, I believe, show significant differences on a raciolinguistic basis.

The outer dikes of civilization are those places in the world that contain mostly people of color, but the inner are those places on the globe that are white settlements in which people of color are increasing, and those areas must be protected.

> Education, schools, and literacy in the US are inner dikes. [page 11]

> There is no more fitting analogy to grading by a standard than [[1920 Stoddard|Stoddard]]'s. Schools, colleges, and universities today are literally and figuratively white settlements (many built on land stolen from indigenous peoples), which have become tacitly, as [[1920 Stoddard|Stoddard]] makes clear, a white entitlement, an inner dike to protect. [page 12]

> This makes grading by a standard the method for protecting and cleaning out the inner dike, whitening it. In short, schools are the inner dikes of literacy as white property. Grading is the gun and bayonet, which are used against all students to cleanse them, to whiten them or drive them out. Again, the rules for grading must change if we wish to stop trying to whiten the dike. [page 12]

> my theorizing of classroom writing assessment as ecology ([[2015 Inoue|Inoue, *Antiracist*]]) [...] can be understood to be made up of at least seven elements: power, purposes, processes, parts, people, products, and places ([[2015 Inoue|176]]). [page 13]

> A grading contract, like any grading system, frames and contextualizes all the activities and people that form the classroom ecology. While any ecological element can be considered and manipulated separately, all seven ecological elements are interconnected and consubstantial to each other ([[2015 Inoue|93]]), often morphing into one another at different moments in the historical unfolding of the ecology. An activity (process) becomes a rubric (part) becomes a figurative place of agreement and contention (place), etc. As complex ecological theory explains ([[2012 Dobrin|Dobrin 144]]), ecologies are holistic in nature, and any given element in the system is more than what it is. The ecology itself is more than the sum of its parts ([[2012 Dobrin|86]]). Understanding the writing assessment ecology of a classroom in this holistic way can help us form antiracist , anti-white supremacist, and other social justice projects through out most fundamental aspect of any course, its assessment ecology. Understanding how my classroom's assessment system is an ecology has allowed me to take advantage of what a labor-based contact offers. [page 13]

> This ability to deny a Black discourse and adopt a white discourse is a white privilege I know I have, one I must acknowledge and problematize continually, one I resist, yet know that I am allowed to take advantage of professionally. [page 15]

> But I'm also resisting a dominant white, academic, linguistic disposition that defines "clarity," "grace," and "eloquence" as a lack of repetition in texts. Repetition can be rhetorically effective. Repetition can slowly reveal the important keynotes in a discussion. Repetition can help a reader feel the ideas more viscerally--feel ideas, not understand them alone. Repetition can be a compassionate, mindful rhetorical practice. And in my case, repetition also satiates my need to help broaden our academic dispositions about language in a counter-rhetorical way, as I've already mentioned above concerning my use of white language supremacy. [page 17]

[[Many rhetorical prohibitions in the standard academic English curriculum are effective rhetorical tools]]

I think it's not that I can't teach alternative rhetorical tools, but I recognize now that I've been centering SAE rhetorical devices to the exclusion of all else. I can teach it as a separate topic, and help students identify it and recognize that there is a time and place, and they have the choice.

### Chapter 1: Problematizing Grading and the White *Habitus* of the Writing Classroom

> I did not begin my journey toward labor-based grading contracts by problematizing my judging practices, though. I started by problematizing grades, which led me to problematize my judgement practices, which then led to problematizing the conditions of white supremacy in my classrooms as an on-going antiracist project. [page 21]

[[A project or agenda doesn't have to be named and outlined first; it can emerge]]

> This chapter lays the important groundwork for that chapter, illustrating why such a grading practice builds equity and inclusion in diverse writing classrooms, illustrating why problematizing assessment in writing classrooms is always necessary if we (teachers and students) are trying to do critical work, work that leads to socially just outcomes. [page 21--22]

> As discussed in Freire's *[[1970 Freire|Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]*, problem-posing education moves through a process of listening to the community outside the classroom, identifying problems or issues, then dialoguing with students using codes, or what [[Ira Shor]] calls "a concrete physical representation of a particularly critical issue that has come up during the listening phase" ([[1987 Shor|"Monday Morning" 38]]). These codes typically are culturally artifacts that embody language, such as media, newspapers, articles, TV shows, movies, plays, etc., that represent many sides of the problem or issue, that reveal the problem as paradoxes. From these codes, students again listen carefully to them in order to describe what they see, hear, and feel, offering their own experiences that relate to those codes, questioning the codes, and of course, moving to articulate things to do as a response ([[2013 Brown|Brown 40-41]]; [[2009 Shor|Shor, "Monday Morning" 39]]). This means that problem-posing is an ongoing process. We never leave the problems. We simply *practice through* them constantly. [page 22]

I'd love to see examples of this in ELA.

> The natures of the problems posed then are paradoxes, which juxtapose personal choice and agency (choosing and acting in agentive and idiosyncratic ways) within larger structures that make up society, or the social that makes up our histories, context, discourses, and the boundaries within which we all act. I often think of the social structural part of problem-posing paradoxes as Marxian determination as [[Raymond Williams]] describes it, or as a "setting of limits" and an "exertion of pressures" ([[1977 Williams|Marxism 87]]). Thus posing problems about my own existential writing assessment situation is articulating paradoxes that complicate how I make judgements, how I read and make meaning of the symbols my students give me and that I give back to them. [page 22]

I don't quite understand this part. The nature of the problems posed in [[Problem-posing Pedagogy|Freirian problem-posing education]] are paradoxes because they are place personal agency against the restraints of larger society, and that "[[Eddie Izzard|reminds me rather]]" of writing assessment because it is also a paradox that pits the individual against institutional constraints. I get that far, but it seems like a loose connection.

> Freire explains that "[i]n problem-posing education, people develop their power to perceive critically the way they exist in the world with which and in which they find themselves; they come to see the world not as a static reality, but as a reality in process, in transformation" ([[Freire 83]]). Thus problem-posing is seeing the paradoxes in the individual's relation to the social and structural. My mentor, [[Victor Villanueva]] offers another way to understand this:
> 
> > Freire juxtaposes two philosophical schools, the existentialism of a [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and the structuralism of a [[Louis Athusser]], to arrive at the heady term of problematizing the existential situation. Simply put, existentialism says that the essences of being human is individual freedom. Structuralism says that there are social, political, and economic systems in place that keep us from changing the way things are, systems that keep us from fully exercising our freedom, systems that we see as "natural." The way out ... is through the problematic, by questioning the things we don't normally question, questioning just how natural the "natural" is. ([[2006 Villanueva|Villanueva 54]])
> 
> [page 23]

> Problematizing my own existential writing assessment situation also helps me decide what data I continually gather from my own classes to help me understand what is happening and how it is working, or what the ecology is doing and producing. [page 23]

> A writing teacher's white racial habitus is key to making relevant selected details of texts, and finding others less relevant or compelling. [page 23]

What is problematizing? I think I do this too, but not sure. It seems like a normal thing that all teachers do.

problematize: make into or regard as a problem requiring a solution; or more specific to this context, it is a critical analysis of a concept. An example of this in social science education would be the famous Nacirema assignment. This concept of problematization seems to come from [[Michel Foucault]], and may be related to [[Actor-network Theory]].

[[Problematization is a process of critically analyzing a concept so as to get past conventional meaning and create a deeper understanding of its true nature]]

From Wikipedia: 
Problematization is a process of stripping away common or conventional understandings of a subject matter in order to gain new insights. This method can be applied to a term, writing, opinion, ideology, identity, or person. Practitioners consider the concrete or existential elements of these subjects. Analyzed as challenges (problems), practitioners may seek to transform the situations under study. It is a method of defamiliarization of common sense.

Problematization is a critical thinking and pedagogical dialogue or process and may be considered demythicisation. Rather than taking the common knowledge (myth) of a situation for granted, problematization poses that knowledge as a problem, allowing new viewpoints, consciousness, reflection, hope, and action to emerge.

Could focusing on habits of mind like curiosity, openness, and engagement be a writing course's way of colonizing our students if we grade them by our standards and measures of what it means to be curious, open, and engaged? Do these habits of mind draw uncritically on white racial habits, thus potentially perpetuating white language supremacy if used as a kind of standard or set of expectations for students' work in classrooms? And how do we know what those noncognitive dimensions of students' learning look like? Might they look different in different students, different groups of students, different contexts and schools, different activities? [page 24]

> the role of assessment in classrooms ... Habits of mind focus on students doing particular things, but for whose purposes? Habits of mind, like habits of language, are also racialized in our society. [page 25]

> So asking "whose purposes" govern assessment in your classroom is a racialized question, even as our curricula and assessment ecologies have striven to present students and teachers with assessment purposes that are neutral, just about learning or linguae. But this implies and belief to be neutral, that it's possible in such ecologies, is a habit of white language (HOWL, discussed below) itself that reproduces particular racialized arrangements in courses. [page 25]

> In their collection on the rhetorics of whiteness, Kennedy, Middleton, and Ratcliffe identify a "haunting whiteness" in the discourses and logics used in contemporary popular culture, education, and social media. This haunting whiteness helps form part of the problematic of classroom writing assessment that I always felt uncomfortable with, even as a student myself, even when I didn't have words for this problem, or understood it as a problematic. Drawing on Freud's analysis of the ego, Kennedy, Middleton, and Ratcliffe explain that whiteness is an identification that functions "as a ghost, a haunting, that feeds on invisibility, nostalgia, and melancholy" (5). This haunting of whiteness in discourses, then, is enthymematic, "wherein major or minor premises are omitted so that hearers may supply them" (6). Stuart Hall identified a similar kind of rhetorical dynamic, saying that race was a "floating signifier," meaning that references to race are never static or permanent. They float and can mean different things to different people, but audiences or readers must, or automatically, supply that meaning. [page 25]

I've never seen the use of the word *problematic* like this. [An article](https://www.radicalphilosophy.com/article/what-is-a-problematic) on French philosopher Bachelard says they came up with the idea, and constructing a problematic is a part of developing a thesis in French schools. It seems to mean a specific problem that is identified out of a larger theme. C.f., narrowing your thesis.

> the nature of whiteness is to float in our classrooms and to be a contradiction in our assessment ecologies. Whiteness can mean what people want it to mean. Most important, seeing whiteness often means seeing paradox. [page 25--26]

[[Being white is not the same as having a white racial habitus.]]

> I use habits of white language (HOWL) to judge the language performances of my students. It feels natural to use HOWL to grade student writing. HOWL clothes me as a teacher like warm robes, vestments, that are easily mistaken to fit everyone just like they fit me. In these ways, HOWL becomes naturalized as universally "good languaging" or "clear writing," even as it is predicated on a haunting, paradoxical nostalgia for language like "when I was in college." [page 26]

[[Comparing what students do with what you were expected to do when you were in college is an unconscious dog whistle, or red flag, for enforcing habits of white languaging, and through it, white supremacy]]

> our bodies mediate our languaging, and thus our various habitus ... others' perceptions of our bodies also mediate how our languaging is read, heard, and judged by those others. [page 26]

> White racial habitus, then, consists of sets of durable, flexible, and often invisible (or naturalized) dispositions to language that are informed by a haunting whiteness (Inoue, Antiracist, 47-51). While realizing that whiteness is not monolithic but also floating, most white racial habitus invoke at least six habits that the literature on whiteness identify in various ways as strong, recurring patterns. These habits are what I mean when I say habits of language, or HOWL. Drawing on [[Sara Ahmed]]'s phenomenological approach to whiteness and Bourdieu's notion of habitus, these habits are:
> 
> - an unseen, naturalized, orientation to the world;
> - hyperindividualism;
> - a stance of neutrality, objectivity, and apoliticality;
> - an individualized, rational, controlled self;
> - a focus on rule-governed, contractual relationships;
> - a focus on clarity, order, and control
> 
> ... which I also call habits of white Discourse. [page 27]

[[Just as there are plural Englishes that float around a nexus of core linguistic features, there are plural whitenesses]]

> The literature on whiteness that I draw on to assemble these six habits of whiteness that can be seen and heard in white racial *habitus* is discussed most directly in Myser (6-7), Inoue (*Antiracist* 48-49; "Friday Plenary" 147), and Ahmed (153-54, 156). Other sources on whiteness that offer insight into whiteness as *habitus* are Barnett, Fannon, Brookhiser, Ratcliffe, and the introduction to Kennedy, Middleton, and Ratcliffe. I offer a handout for teachers and students on HOWL at <https://tinyurl.com/HOWLhandout6>. You can also find a blogpost of mine on HOWL at <https://asaobinoue.blogspot.com/2021/07/blogbook-habits-of-white-language-howl.html>. [page 27]

> seeing whiteness in your own practices does not mean that you are deploying HOWL toward white supremacist ends nor that you are producing racist consequences, but it likely means that white supremacy is a possible outcome in the classroom assessment ecology you participate in because of HOWL's presence if you don't explicitly do something to counter it. Labor-based grading attempts to do this dismantling and countering of white language supremacy. [page 27]

> white language supremacy is a condition and outcome structured in assessment ecologies in such a way as to function simultaneously as an ideal and as the norm. [page 27]

> the paradox in educational systems is that those systems that we have to work in set limits and exert pressure on us to grade, and to grade by quality, quality that is determined by white racial *habitus* that structure our disciplines and social settings, which hold the most economic and cultural power. [page 27]

> When we grade, evaluate, and give feedback to our students' languaging, performances, we encourage interpellation through our HOWLing. We teachers also interpellate ourselves in such places, and we ask students to interpellate themselves. [page 27]

> Louis Althusser defines "interpellation" as a "hail" or a call to the individual that makes the individual a subject. He explains: "all ideology hails or interpellates concrete individuals as concrete subjects, by the functioning of the category of the subject" (173). Furthermore, "individuals are always-already subjects" (175-76) since we are born into a world of ideology with rituals before us that constitute the subject as a category of existence, which calls us and we recognize. Interpellation, then, is a way to see habits as always-already a part of the rituals that hail concrete subjects out of discourses and practices-- or the process of hailing in assessment ecologies. [page 27--28]

[[Althusser's interpellation or hailing is an unconscious process that turns something into a subject by calling attention to it and expecting a response]]

From Wikipedia:
	Always already is a philosophical term regarding the perception of phenomena by the mind of an observer. The features of a phenomenon that seem to precede any perception of it are said to be "always already" present. 

It seems to come from [[Martin Heidegger]] and his [[1927 Heidegger|Being and Time]].

[[The concept of always-already, or immer schon refers to an action or state that has continued without any known beginning]]

> These interpellations cause contradictions. We want our students to be free and agentive, but those concepts are soaked in a white history, and associated with primarily white bodies. Everyone wants to be free. No one wants to be told what to do. But isn't a big part of being a teacher or professor telling students what to do, manipulating behavior through feedback and grades, and through the awarding of "extra credit"? [page 27--28]

> How could my students be liberated if most of them were tacitly being told to take on a different *habitus* just to do the work of the course? I was asking my student to interpellate themselves through my own HOWLing examples. How could my students of color pose their own problems if I wasn't allowing them to use their only language? How could my classroom be anything but a whitely "They classroom" to my students of color? [page 32]

> Foucault's *Discipline and Punish* ... Our classroom assessment ecologies discipline our students in determined ways, ways that are constrained yet still have some degree of choice in them. So to say classroom assessment spaces discipline our students by constraining and pressuring them is to say that our assessment ecologies, which loosely is everything we do around student writing, is a determined docile-making ecological practice. [page 35]

> To create a determined docile-making place, the teacher must employ the "art of distributions," which amounts to constructing enclosures for bodies (141), then partitioning those enclosures so that each student may have their own designated place (143). Desks, individual papers or assignments, rubrics, scoring guides, writing groups, and grades all do this enclosing and partitioning. But these enclosures also need to be useful, functional- (143--44) [page 35--36]

[[Grading is a practice that sets students up to adopt docile habits]]

I should be exploring other ways to learn language-- especially oral and storytelling methods.

> These enclosures categorize students and their performances out of constructed necessity, another oxymoron. Educational institutions require such enclosures and partitioning, so it is necessary to some degree for teachers and students, yet that institutional necessity is not natural but constructed. There are other ways to teach and learn, perhaps without enclosures or partitions. Most important, these enclosures are determined by the educational system, familiar to students and teachers, and so seem natural. [page 36]

> What enclosures do I make? What enclosures does my institution make for me to use? What purposes does my school have for these enclosures? What are their purposes in my classroom 's assessment ecology do I create for those enclosures? How do they function (a much harder question to answer)? What are their effects on my students and their learning? What are their effects on me as a teacher or reader? How might my classroom do without some or all of them and still achieve our goals? [page 36]

> grades are hierarchical in nature and create hierarchical partitions [page 36]

> Kung Fu (Gung Fu) ... there were no grade-partitions, yet the system has worked for centuries to teach and learn. Half the dojos I was a part of didn't even have belt systems, a set of hierarchical enclosures that discipline students. In fact, I unconsciously avoided those dojos that used belt systems. [page 37]

> We know [using hierarchies] is mostly unnecessary, perhaps even harmful to many students, as others before me have highlighted, particularly around grades (Bleich; Elbow “Grading," “Ranking," “Taking," Kohn). [page 37]

> Foucault would say that students "may traverse [these intervals or spaces] one after the other" (145-46). He called this mobility of bodies, this disciplining through interchangeable spaces, as “an art of rank, a technique for the transformation of arrangements. It individualizes bodies by a location that does not give them a fixed position, but distributes them and circulates them in a network of relations" (146). It is a reward system that creates individuals to be rewarded through their ability to move around in the system from one partition to the next, one enclosure to the next. It encourages consent on an individual basis in the system by holding out some carrot or reward down the road, which is reinforced by mobility in the system, the moving from space to space by individuals. Moving up or around in the educational system of the classroom means you are getting somewhere, so you consent as long as you keep getting somewhere. The most used carrot that encourages mobility in such systems is a grade. The important thing is that the big carrot is down the road. The ultimate reward is never quite now. That 's what keeps folks in their place, consenting and docile. That 's what allows students of color to be internally colonized. They, the collective, may have all failed but I, the individual, will be the exception!

How does this relate to collective vs. individual bargaining in the workplace?
[[Grades move students through manufactured and hierarchical positions to give a sense of reward and investment]]

> When I consider my past uses of grading, my students certainly moved along in my system, getting better, achieving higher grades, grades I invented, grades I determined. In a U.S. context, this art of rank feeds on the myth of meritocracy, the bootstraps myth. As long as my students were moving from space to space in the ecology, I felt that they were moving up, were upwardly mobile. Perhaps they felt they were making it on their own, developing and growing by their own talents. But of course, my students did not get their grades by themselves. Those grades required a grader, me, to do the grading, no matter what the student did. [page 38]

> *Languaging* is gesturing which comes from dispositions to do particular actions, all of which are a part of our *habitus*. Our languaging is behavior that comes out of our racial and other *habitus*. And dialectically, the racial *habitus* we share influence us. [page 39]

[[Inoue defines languaging as a gesture coming from our habits of mind]]

> The discipline of Rhetoric and Composition already works from the assumption that writing classrooms discipline bodies, making them into our own images, our own whitely habitus. [page 39]

> Habits of mind share more with noncognitive domains than the cognitive ones we 've come to measure in writing assessments of all types, which tend to be thought of as "direct evidence" of learning in writing classrooms, but are really only the products of that learning (I 'll say more about noncognitive dimensions and assessing effectiveness of labor-based grading systems in Chapter 7). Learning is the activity, the doing, a verb. Essays and portfolios are the products of that learning, a noun. We never have full access to students ' learning, only to the products of that learning. This is another reason we should be skeptical of grades that purport to say something about students ' learning. Grades are not the learning. They only can be an indirect measure of another indirect measure of learning, that is, of the products of the practices of learning, not that actual learning itself, which is bodily and experiential. [page 40]

[[Grades are an indirect measure of learning]]

> It may also be useful to note that the word "essay" comes from the French word (essayer), “to try," which Michel de Montaigne helped coin.

> People do habits. Texts do not. ... Bourdieu 's habitus ... are durable, transposable dispositions, meaning they resist erasure and change or evolve with the changing ecologies in which that body circulates. Like ourselves and language itself, our habitus is always becoming. The paradox here is that if all languaging is becoming, then it is both evolving and beautiful. [page 40]

> N. Volosinov describes the historical nature of language systems and utterances. He 's responding to Saussure 's ideas about langue and parole, that there 's a distinction between a language system and various concrete, idiosyncratic utterances that deviate from that system. And this debate about whether there can be a language system that is outside of individual utterances, an ideal or even a standard, is exactly at the center of grading practices and the role of judgment in writing classrooms. Volosinov describes language as "a ceaseless flow of becoming," arguing that there is no langue, only parole, only the historically idiosyncratic that continually evolves (66). Habitus also are historically situated and evolve over time and in contexts. There is no static or universal--no langue--no single white racial habitus, only historically situated, idiosyncratic instantiations, all becoming something else on their own. Habitus, including white racial habitus, is plural and continually evolving. [page 40--41]

> If all habitus are becoming, then it is difficult to justify a preferred habitus in writing classrooms for any other reason than the one given in the CCCC 's Statement on Students ' Right to Their Own Language, which refers to a CCCC 's Executive Committee resolution passed in 1972: 
> 
> > Language scholars long ago denied that the myth of a standard American dialect has any validity. The claim that any one dialect is unacceptable amounts to an attempt of one social group to exert its dominance over another. Such a claim leads to false advice for speakers and writers, and immoral advice for humans. ([[1974 Conference on College Composition and Communication|Committee on CCCC Language Statement 2-3]])

This is the maximizing of bodily labor and movements, of being efficient and productive, of learning all you can, that is, learning as much as you can, getting the most of the class. Can you hear the metaphors of quantity and efficiency? We might see this disciplining through the ways teachers expect particular purposes from revisions and other labors in and outside of class, or what we expect as products of such labors, or how much change in a draft we expect from revisions because, well, we talked about that in our feedback. [page 42--43]

> Often we expect students to "use their time wisely," and “productively," which [[Richard Brookhiser]] identifies as traits of WASPness that are inherited from [[Benjamin Franklin]]. [[Richard Brookhiser|Brookhiser]] calls them “industry" ([[1997 Brookhiser|17]]) and “usefulness" ([[1997 Brookhiser|19]]). Surely, these assumptions that build the discourses of judgment in our assessment ecologies, that can easily be heard in the habits of mind articulated in the Framework for Success in Postsecondary Writing, are not all bad, but are they all good when used to grade students? Should they be used to rank students, create partitions and enclosures, to interpellate? How natural should they be in our classrooms ' assessment ecologies? Should we not problematize them with students? [page 43]

> The term "WASP" has come to mean “white, Anglo-Saxon Protestant" by the middle of the twentieth century. When describing the group of people who have controlled the political, economic, and cultural centers of the US, the political scientist [[Andrew Hacker]] defined WASP this way in 1952: “they are white, they are Anglo-Saxon in origin, and they are Protestant (and disproportionately Episcopalian). To their Waspishness should be added the tendency to be located on the Eastern seaboard or around San Francisco, to be prep school and Ivy League educated, and to be possessed of inherited wealth" ([[1952 Hacker|1011]]).

> Do we force our movements on students and attempt to extract the most from their time and labors? Is this unfair to some students? Does it privilege others? And how do we, then, promote all students ' rights to their own languages in our assessment ecologies when one standard is determined for our classrooms, or when others outside our classrooms do not understand the racism in such a single standard? [page 43]

> If a writing teacher designs their assessment ecologies by trying to be fair to all their students, they likely will assume that treating everyone the same, judging them by the same standard, is fair. Fairness means everyone has access to the system in the same way, but everyone does not have access to the system in the same way. Everyone is not located in the system in the same place. [page 44]

Sometimes I think about what made me different such that I can learn easily on my own, and why other people can struggle. One big difference though is that I didn't go to high school and was self-educated through my teens and 20s until I started going to college; by then I had enough love of learning independently and I was able to succeed in college; at least in the academic part.

> find preferable is to design assessment ecologies by trying not to be unfair, which works from a different assumption: that the systems we circulate in, like our classrooms, departments, schools, disciplines, and society are not inherently fair to everyone. They are structured in such a way as to provide more access and opportunities to some students--in my assessment work, I focus on racialized intersectional patterns of unfairness--mostly determined by luck of birth. [page 44]

> Our society and schools may be pluralistic and diverse, but the systems and structures that organize them do not account well for a plurality of languages or a diversity of embodied students [page 44]

> the spaces and enclosures created are ones based on the teacher 's haunting white habitus. And doing this, we de facto stop giving students their rights to their own languages. No matter how delayed our grades are, the ghosts of white racial habitus are still present and felt by everyone in the ecology. [page 45]

Reflecting on the enclosures that exist in my class should be a regular [[End of semester review]].

> It is their habits, not ours, we want them to mind, but really the ideal habits are not theirs but our habits we mind. And yet, the problematic here is that our students are in our classes to learn new things, new languaging. How else will they learn but to take on different habits, to become new habitus? This is the nature of becoming! Isn't being held to foreign standards how any habitus becomes something else? And isn't that why our students come to us? 
> 
> Our students have to take responsibility, don't they? It 's not our fault students fail, even though the way the ecology is set up is our fault. The system of enclosures is our fault. The disciplining and punishing is our fault. The determining of students ' choice to be docile in particular ways is our fault. The way we treat students is our fault. Meanwhile, we writing teachers, can feel self-righteous about how well we treat and think of our students. And some, mostly white students, or those who have taken on a white racial habitus in their minds-bodies, will even say, "I don't know what all the fuss is about. Just do the work." And it may be true. And there 's the paradox, the problem posed about determined, docile-making writing assessment ecologies. Teachers aren't bad people. Our work is not evil work. We want our students to do good work. We do have some agency in the determined school systems that place limits and pressures on all of us. I sure feel like I have. [page 45]

[[Students who have or are adjacent to privilege may not notice the struggle of adopting a white language habitus that other students do]]

> For many multilingual students and students of color, docile-making assessment ecologies lead to determined failure and feeling bad about oneself and one 's writing, even when in a few instances, it may lead to so-called success. Enclosures create such feelings and psychologies that are wholly unnecessary for learning. [page 46]

[[Enclosures are parts of the classroom ecology that categorize, sort, restrict, and define students]]

> The carrot of success, which is a euphemism for taking on a white racial habitus, keeps us from realizing just how internally colonized by grades and the hegemonic white racial habitus we all are. Drawing on Burke, [[Victor Villanueva|Villanueva]] puts this dynamic rightly when explaining the new racism, the racism without explicitly mentioning race: "synecdoche is representation . . . synecdoche carries it all. No more talk of races; no more talk of religions, or nationalities, or languages, while talking about all of them, mixing them up in the most unsettling ways" ([[2006 Villanueva|9]]). While [[Victor Villanueva|Villanueva]] is speaking about writing center work, seeing the judgment of student writing in classrooms as a racialized practice that depends on white racial habitus, which function through the trope of synecdoche, is instructive and paradoxical. Our students are in our classrooms to learn rhetorical practices that will help them as citizens who must language in the world. They need us for this work. It is also a critical learning of a white racial habitus, or maybe a learning of ways to become against it and the institutional systems that reproduce white language privilege. [page 46]

[[Success in conventional classrooms is synonymous with adopting a white racial habitus]]

**Syndoche** is a figure of speech in which a part of something is made to represent the whole.

> > He had been telling me specific features that he thought were right or needed correction. Not his judgment of rank but his specific observations were pertinent, whether he was teaching or just talking to me. Imagine that you are a prospective employer, and I know a student better than you do. You ask, not for my verdict, but for what I have observed, that you may judge for yourself. If I say, "I gave your applicant a ‘76 '" and walk off, you have no observations but a perfunctory statement of my conclusions. Perhaps you are learning to drive, to paint, or to play the piano. You look to your mentors for guidance, not for their judgments. You learn to do these things because your primary interest and responsibility is with your own life and future, not just with outranking someone. [page 47]

> (Tchudi; Zak and Weaver; Allison et al.). Grading seemed to get in the way of the conversations I wanted to have with students about their writing. It was a barrier when I would tell a multilingual student or a working-class white student, for instance, that her writing was interesting and moving, yet the C-grade seemed to say something else. [page 47--48]

> Most just wanted to follow my orders, or took everything I said as an order, but I wanted them to talk through my words, think with me about their writing, and make their own decisions. Many of my students seemed resigned to low grades and following orders, and I felt it wasn't all their fault. It was in part my fault. Beyond these pedagogical problems, I found myself hating to read student writing, even though I loved talking to students about their writing. [page 48]

This resonates with me a lot; sounds very familiar. This is my struggle almost every semester.

> On the first day of the semester, Bill walked into class and quickly handed out a page copied from an academic journal. He said we were going to engage in a reading exercise. He wanted us to count the number of e 's on the page. Because we were all good doctoral students, we dutifully counted. A few minutes later, Bill asked us to go up to the board and write our answers. How many e 's were there on the page? We all went up at the same time and wrote a different number. There were as many answers as there were students in the class. How could this be? What did it mean? I was shocked. Had I messed up my counting? Didn't we all have the same page? Yes, Bill confirmed that we did. He said if we, a group of smart doctoral students in an English Department, couldn't agree on the number of e 's on a single piece of paper, a simple act of assessment, how could we possibly expect to agree on much more sophisticated and complex dimensions of the same page, like effectiveness or what it says, or how proficient it is? This was my entry into writing assessment. And through that class, I came to community-based assessment pedagogy, the practice and the article. 

[[Bill Condon]] did an experiment in his writing assessment class where he asked teacher-students to count the number of a specific letter on an writing sample. Each person had a different answer. This was done to make the point that if they couldn't agree on concrete details, they cannot expect to agree on subjective ones like writing quality.

> In the article, I argue for a cycle of rubric building, using, and reflection activities that lead to the use of a rubric in peer assessment activities, which culminate in a richer, more textured set of categorical assessments of students ' writing without using grades on anything. At the end of the course, instead of the teacher evaluating the student 's portfolio of work, the student collects several peer evaluations using our rubric along with their own self-evaluations. The student and I would sit down together and read all of them, then I 'd read my own prepared evaluation of the portfolio, none of which would have grades on them, instead we had a simple categorical decision to make for each rubric dimension: does this student 's portfolio meet, not meet, or exceed the expectations of our portfolio rubric along each dimension and how does it do that? These judgments and their reasonings were recorded in each assessment document.
> 
> In final conferences, we looked at the landscape of evaluations--peers, self, mine--and came to what I called "hard agreements" about what overall assessments we could make given what folks said about the writer 's portfolio and the evidence they 'd provided for those assessments. The final course grade was determined by deciding how many of the rubric dimensions met, exceeded, or didn't meet basic expectations along all portfolio rubric dimensions, which we 'd also collaboratively created, discussed, revised, and reflected upon over the semester. If we could argue that more than half of the rubric dimensions were exceeding expectations, then the student would receive an A, if most were meeting expectations, then a B. If there were a few not meeting, then a C. If more than half were not meeting expectations, then a D. If the writer 's portfolio couldn't be argued that it met any of the class ' expectations along any of the rubric dimensions, the student got an "F." This course grading system was still a quality-based grading system--that is, the final course grade depended on a discussion of the judgments of quality, albeit by several colleagues, the student-writer, and me. [page 52]

[[Asao Inoue argued for community-based assessment; a system of grading that combines teacher and peer student evaluations using rubrics]]

> In my estimation, while it didn't address the power differential between my students and myself in our assessments of portfolios (mine was always going to hold more weight in those final discussions), **nor did the system account well for the ways some white and Asian female students didn't seem to resist as much the negative assessments of their writing by others, as white male students generally did**, community-based assessment pedagogy was still a fairer system than conventional grading systems for three reasons. First, it offered students some added control and agency in what constitutes quality through rubric generation and reflection activities, as well as those final assessments. This leads to added agency in those discussions in the final conferences, where students get more voice in what their final grade ends up being. They get to argue, in a sense, or defend, their preferred grade, based on evidence. More importantly, they have a real and materially present voice at the table when the teacher determines course grades. Along with this, that course grade is also produced more collaboratively, not by one judge (the teacher) alone. While later I would see the intersectional, gendered, and racialized problems with various students trying to defend or argue for an assessment or a grade to an authority figure who is steeped in a masculine, white habitus of the university, at this early stage, this was still better than conventional power dynamics in teacher-only grading systems. [page 53]

[[Criticisms of community-based assessment include failing to equalize power dynamics, as well as gender and racial biases]]

[[In a negotiated assessment ecology, male and white students are more likely to defend their work which therefore introduces a gender and racial bias in the grading system]]

> Second, community-based assessment pedagogy reduced the number of grade distinctions possible. The assessment literature is clear on this point, and it 's more nuanced than what it seems at first glance. The fewer distinctions judges make, the more reliable those decisions are--that is, the more agreement there will be among various readers. [page 53]

[[The fewer grading categories or measurement points tends to be make for a more reliable measurement which increases inter-rater reliability]]

> The initial categorical decision could be seen as a judgment much like criterion referenced tests offer. Criterion-referenced tests purport to show how well a person does compared to a particular skill, outcome, or construct already identified, such as the expectations listed on our rubric (the criteria). Meanwhile, I was urging students to make the higher decision, whether a portfolio exceeded expectations along any given rubric dimension, using a norm referenced model of judgment. Norm-referenced tests purport to measure test takers relative to other test takers. In other words, one is exceeding expectations based on the reader 's sense of what other writers in the class are doing (or not able to do). [page 54]

[[Criterion-reference assessments can easily become norm-referenced when the standard is not applied blindly]]

> Exemplar categorization says that people "categorize by comparing a new instance with intact memories (‘exemplars') of similar instances" (Haswell 247). Thus we read a text looking to see how closely it fits to significant features of a most representative or best example of the category. Our rubric-building process assumed a kind of reverse method for producing the categories and descriptive features. It began with actual known exemplars, texts we brought to class, ones we wanted to imitate as writers. Through a series of activities, we derived dimensions of writing from them and those dimensions ' features, which we then used to help us make judgments on each other 's drafts and portfolios in the assessment documents. This process was influenced by [[Bob Broad]] 's dynamic criteria mapping process (see Chapter 5 of Broad). In use, the actual exemplars that our rubric was based on go away, and what remains is a bricolage of exemplar-inspired dimensions that we use to remind us of our priorities when assessing. [page 55]

[[Exemplar categorization is the process of comparing an instance of something with an easily identified example in memory]]

> The prototype for any category is, then, an "idealized construction," a “convenient grammatical fiction" (Haswell 246; Rosch 40). So we don't actually use a real example when we judge instances, instead we use convenient fictions, prototypes in our heads that are cobbled together from various examples. Our rubric, then, was heuristical in nature, [page 55]

[[Writing assessment does not use real examples as a reference, but uses what Inoue calls exemplar-inspired dimensions]]

> even though we are sharing the same rubric and coming to agreements about what categories mean. But since we always work from our own mental, idealized constructions of things, this paradigm of judgment seems to explain best what we were trying to do and how it would inevitably be uneven in application--there would be necessary disagreement. [page 55]

[[Inter-rater reliability is always less than ideal because each rater has a different set of exemplars of the variables being assessed]]

> I just got my students to manage those enclosures with me. Many of these contradictions occurred because the university required grades.

> I was fortunate enough to get feedback from Peter Elbow on the article. He was one of the reviewers ... I had cut my teeth on Writing Without Teachers, which had been suggested to me by Chris Anderson, my first mentor and the Director of Writing at Oregon State a decade earlier.
> [Elbow] gave me his grading contract, a version of the one he and Jane Danielewicz published later (Danielewicz and Elbow), but Peter had been using and working on contracts and alternative systems of judgment in writing classrooms for at least a decade before (Elbow, "Grading Writing," “Taking Time Out," and “Ranking"). [page 57]

> First Try, Grading Contracts
> 
> The grading contract I inherited from Peter Elbow judged two kinds of evidence from students ' learning in the classroom to determine some course grades (those above the default B grade), which Danielewicz and Elbow refer to as a "hybrid grading contract" (250). [page 57]

[[Hybrid-grading contracts, as used by Danielewicz, and Elbow, refer to using two sets of criteria for students above and below a default grade]]

> promised students: Behave in a particular way described in the contract, do the work asked in the spirit it is assigned, and you are guaranteed a "B" course grade, no matter what I think of your writing. I took this language from the contract Peter shared with me. But A grades required different evidence to be judged. [page 58]

> [Danielewicz and Elbow] explain that a course grade of B "should be available to every student--that is, not dependent on skill or prior training" [page 58]

In the hybrid grading contract, Inoue gave any student at least a B regardless of their writing quality as long as they did the work and behaviors expected of them in the contract. Higher grades required an assessment of writing quality.

It would make sense to do that first part (which I suppose is a pure labor-based grading contract) for my classes since they are pass/fail, and a passing grade confers only a 2.0 GPA anyway; same as a C. 

Moving to labor-based assessment from criteria-based assessment might be a hard sell to some of the faculty. Possible arguments they'd present:
- Some students do work all the work and work hard, but still fail to achieve the necessary proficiency.
	- ask for data; how many students? is it significant? does the consequence of letting those students proceed to the next class outweigh the consequences of equating success with the adoption of a white racial habitus?
- Students can just lie or fabricate evidence of their labor; it's much harder to fake a presentation or in-class writing assessment.
	- refer to the literature on the racial habitus bias in writing assessment

Middle ground would be to propose less racialized criteria that focus exclusively on literal comprehension, if that's possible.

> Hybrid contracts ' basic premise is clear: your assessment ecology will keep the most exemplary grades away from some students, regardless of their desires for those grades or the amount of work they are willing to put into their writing in order to get those grades. More often than not, these students will be students of color, working-class, and multilingual students--students with habitus other than the dominant white racial habitus embodied in the teacher, rubric, standards, and course outcomes. Thus, grades of A in Danielewicz and Elbow 's hybrid contract system are determined by a teacher 's judgment of the habitus that are embodied in students ' languaging. It didn't take long for me to feel uncomfortable about this problem in hybrid contracts. And it amounts to hybrid contracts being subtly racist and white supremacist. [page 58]

[[Hybrid-grading contracts, as used by Danielewicz and Elbow, fail to avoid the bias and judgement of white racial habitus]]

[[Hybrid-grading contracts, as used by Danielewicz and Elbow, unintentionally reserve the highest grades for students who adopt a white racial habitus]]

How did Danielewicz and Elbow respond to this criticism? Maybe it's to early to tell, but there are lots of case studies of implementations of hybrid-grading contracts and community-based assessment to follow up with.

> However, in my system, the A-grades were collaboratively determined by considering carefully and with the student all the assessment documents on their final portfolio. So instead of five grade distinctions to make, students and I now only had one. It was more elegant and simpler. There was more agreement and fairness, since students helped figure the grade out. [page 58--59]

Inoue claims that his community (or maybe just collaborative) based assessment layer to the higher rank of the hybrid grading contract was fair since students helped him make the singular grading decision. However, as he points out [[@2022inoue_labor#^326c0f|earlier]], this still allows for a negative influence from imposter phenomenon and stereotyping threat. [[In a negotiated assessment ecology, male and white students are more likely to defend their work which therefore introduces a gender and racial bias in the grading system]]

> dominant academic discourses (or DADs). ... I often begin talking with my students about dominant standards of English by referring to them as "DAD"-- our DAD is our dominant academic discourse-- but DADs are really the dominant white *habitus* that are embodied in language standards and norms. [page 59]

[[Dominant academic discourses are white habits of language]]

I should add a section related to this in [[ESI-024 Module 1]]. This is where Global Englishes can come in-- or theory about how different dialects and creoles can work together. [[2015 Jenkins]] might be a good place to start.

> As Danielewicz and Elbow say, some students will not be able to attain an excellent or superior judgement in these dominant discourses because their literacy practices are just different-- they didn't grow up in white, middle-class households-- and ten or fifteen weeks of instruction is just not enough time to change these linguistic realities. [page 59]

[[Acquisition of white languaging does not fit the pre-academic English preparation course sequence timeline]]

> the same students who benefit from conventional grading systems that use a white, middle-class standard discourse are privileged and placed at the top of the grading pyramid and rewarded for less labor because their white racial *habitus* is the center of all DADs. ... students of color and multilingual students often worked harder but achieved a lower course grade. [page 59]

> I was trying to give them a right to their own languages, but the grading system still didn't fully allow this. ... they only had a right to a B-grade. ... at least students who actually took my words to heart couldn't fail the class. [page 59]

> for those students who wanted an A-grade, they really did have to care about their colleagues' and my judgements of their writing-- they had to follow orders-- which always meant imitating a dominant white racial *habitus*. [page 60]

> a racist problematic: All students had a right to their own languages, just not a right to an A, not a right to have their languages valued most highly, unless that language matched a white racial *habitus*. So hybrid grading contracts still participated in white language supremacy. [page 60]

[[Hybrid grading contracts still uphold a racialized cultural-linguistic standard because they grade based on the perception of language quality]]

> To use the metaphor of the early twentieth century, racist, separatist, and eugenicist, [[Lothrop Stoddard]], in *[[1920 Stoddard|The Rising Tide of Color]]*, hybrid grading contracts maintain the white center by managing the "inner dikes" that protect them. The white center is the A-grade partition, while the inner dike is the B-grade territory, open to all in the contract, but carefully separated from the A-grade by maintaining the dominant white racial linguistic standard. This means the "outer dikes" are the less-preferred, lower-grade-lands. [page 60]

> The grading philosophy, to me, sounds like this: Let the Brown and Black folks have their Bs and Cs. Let hem pass writing courses. Meanwhile, the As, the real opportunities and high GPAs, will be reserved for those who can embody a dominant white racial *habitus*, which means white students get overrepresented in the A category. The world and its educational opportunities remains guarded from the rising tide of color in our schools through the system of inner and outer grade dikes. [page 60]

[[Judgements of language quality in any grading contract give rise to Stoddardian dikes; a racialized grading apartheid]]

> I could and did get my students-- even students of color-- to voice their own oppression. This is how we internally colonized our students. We get them to enforce the partitions and dikes of grading with us. [page 60]

I wonder if we ([[Elizabeth Baertlein]], [[Lisa Angelella]], and others) could survey FYW faculty to gauge their interest in [[Critical Pedagogy]] topics and that might help us design more targeted discussion and reading groups. Somewhat related to [[Critical Pedagogy Professional Working Group]] and [[Critical ESL Reading Group]].

> A student who wrote in Black English or Spanglish could pass the class with a B, but couldn't realistically get an A. [page 61]

> The lesson was that anything other than the white DAD of the classroom was less than, was sub-standard, and was not excellent writing. This meant that those of us who didn't grow up with a white DAD, likely couldn't get the A. [page 61]

I like the turn of phrase here, with "grow up with a white DAD." There's some utility in that acronym.

> Social justice writing assessment projects make people's lives better, give them equitable opportunities, expand boundaries, question the authoritative and hegemonic, not simply give some students a few more opportunities, or second-class status, even though that status is better than the third-class one they are accustomed to.

What are some problem-posing/social justice writing projects that could be done at level 2? I think at level 2, we're bridging the individual and community levels of generalization; introducing and developing tense control, so narrative is a good target.

> Most published work up to the early 2000s discussed learning contracts, not grading contracts, and came from education circles (e.g. [[1975 Berte|Berte]]; [[1986 Knowles|Knowles]]; [[1996 Anderson et al.|Anderson]], Boud, and Sampson). Researchers tend to discuss learning contracts in terms of K-12, adult education, or nursing contexts. Often, the articles and books avoid any detailed discussion of how course grades are exactly determined. This makes sense. Learning contracts are designed to help learners achieve particular learning outcomes, not grades. They are more concerned with helping students master particular tasks or outcomes, like setting a broken leg or diagnosing a patient. [page 61]

[[Learning contracts are different from grading contracts in that they focus on achieving specific learning outcomes]]

Neither Boud nor Sampson are cited in the book, but they both wrote about [[Peer Learning]]. [[2001 Boud & Sampson]] is one such source.

> In using learning contracts in self-directed, second language learning classrooms in [[Singapore]] and [[Canada]], [[Hedy McGarrell]] offers similar ways to structure contracts in English language learning classrooms. The main elements of [[Hedy McGarrell|McGarrell]]'s contracts address:
> 
> 1. "What will the learner learn?" ([[1996 McGarrell|497]]);
> 2. "How will the learner accomplish an identified short-term objective?" ([[1996 McGarrell|498]]);
> 3. "When does the learner expect to achieve a given objective? ([[1996 McGarrell|498]]); 
> 4. "How will the learner demonstrate what he/she learned?" ([[1996 McGarrell|498]]); and
> 5. "[H]ow will the learner's demonstration of achievement be evaluated and by whom? ([[1996 McGarrell|498]]).

I can do these with students. I can ask them to identify goals for the semester and work with them. Kind of what [[Dawn Wood]] do for their faculty for faculty development. [[End of semester review]]

> She goes on to say that some teachers may find it helpful to evaluate the student's performance, but should avoid "instructor-centered techniques." Her suggestions amount to the teacher "remain[ing] a facilitator, rather than a judge, of the learning process" ([[1996 McGarrell|499]]). [[Hedy McGarrell|McGarrell]] promotes a kind of assessment ecology that I was (and still am) looking for, one that gives students more control over the ecology and is flexible for a variety of learning paces and styles. But there is a difference between allowing students control over the evaluation of the evidence of their learning and allowing students to control how their course grades are calculated from judgements upon that evidence. As [[Stephen Tchudi]] reminds us, there are differences between response, assessment, evaluation, and grading ([[1997 Tchudi|xv]]). And this is why, I'm sure, [[Hedy McGarrell|McGarrell]] pushes for an avoidance of instructor-centered evaluation, but it's unclear if that includes grading. [page 62]

What does it mean to be truly student-centered? Or for that matter, teacher-centered?

[[McGarrell promotes a classroom ecology that avoids instructor evaluation in the form of grades, but does not preclude extensive feedback]]

It is a means of designing a learning activity with the focus on the learner rather than the subject or the teacher. For this reason learning contracts are particularly suitable for structuring assignments and projects which are largely self-directed, for use in courses in which particupants come from a diversity of backgrounds and in tailoring learning to indiviual needs and interests.

> Thus [[learning contracts]] promote student responsibility, agency, and control in mostly self-governed, learning processes, with an attention to what that process is meant to achieve or produce, and how that learning is evaluated for success or completion. They promote metacognition through the ways the learner must help develop the contract with the teacher, articulating what goals they wish to achieve, what evidence of success looks like, and in some cases, even assessing their own completion of the contract. But most of the literature on learning contracts do not give students any explicit control or responsibility for their course grades [page 63]

[[Learning contracts can have agentive and metacognitive benefits, but still leave grading instructor-controlled]]

[[Learning contracts have been focusing on process and metacognition for awhile, but Inoue takes it further to tie grading into it as well]]

> The relatively few articles that were published on grading contracts in college classrooms come mostly in the 1970s, '90s, and early 2000s, sprinkled here and there. There have been some articles on [[grading contracts]] as modified, criterion-referenced systems in higher education ([[1979 Hassencahl|Hassencahl]]), some of which look at students ' favorable reactions to them in teacher education courses ([[1971 Taylor|Taylor]]; [[2009 Brubaker|Brubaker]]), college nutrition and food management courses ([[1977 Blankenship|Blankenship]]), and agriculture education courses ([[1973 Newcomb|Newcomb]]), while others consider their success in accounting courses ([[1998 Zarzeski|Zarzeski]]), larger psychology courses ([[1975 Kirschenbaum & Riechmann|Kirschenbaum and Riechmann]]), as well as speech communication ([[1975 Stelzner|Stelzner]]; [[1975 Wolvin & Wolvin|Wolvin and Wolvin]]), and nursing courses ([[1982 Kruse & Barger|Kruse and Barger]]; [[1977 Crancer|Crancer]], Maury-Hess, and Dunn). Some have discussed [[grading contracts]] ' uses to enhance critical pedagogies ([[1992 Shor|Shor, Empowering Education 159]]; [[2009 Shor|"Critical Pedagogy"]]) and postmodern pedagogies (Hiller and Hietapelto), or simply as a more efficient method for calculating grades that helps students write more ([[1980 Leahy|Leahy]]). Most in one way or another, make a point to discuss the democratizing elements of grading contracts, giving students more control in courses and power over their grades ([[2009 Danielewicz & Elbow|Danielewicz and Elbow]]; Inoue, Antiracist), as well as authority in the classroom ([[2009 Brubaker|Burbaker]]). There also have been studies about grading contract systems in college business courses that show a statistically significant increase in motivation and effort ([[1977 Polczynski & Shirland|Polczynski and Shirland]]), while more recent studies have shown mixed results from first-year writing students ([[2003 Spidell & Thelin|Spidell and Thelin]]; [[2018 Inman & Powell|Inman and Powell]]) and statistically significant differences in performances and attitudes about the contract in students of color in a writing program ([[2012 Inoue|Inoue, "Grading Contracts"]]). All of this scholarship on grading contracts, however, uses hybrid contracts. I'll discuss in more detail [[2003 Spidell & Thelin|Spidell and Thelin]]'s and [[2018 Inman & Powell|Inman and Powell]]'s studies together in Chapter 7, where I discuss two criticisms of hybrid grading contracts that could be leveled against labor-based ones, so I'll avoid my critique of them here. [page 63--64]

> This exception, as far as I can tell, is in my own scholarship. While not all the grading contracts in [[2012 Inoue|"Grading Contracts"]] were purely labor-based, most were, and my own in *[[2015 Inoue|Antiracist]]* was . But of course, I didn't have this scholarship available to me when I was looking for a better contract system. [page 64]

> Most discussions assume a binary of quantity vs. quality ([[1997 Bauman|Bauman 165]]; [[1997 Shiffman|Shiffman 67-58]]; [[2003 Reichert|Reichert 60]]; [[2009 Danielewicz & Elbow|Danielewicz and Elbow 250]]). The two competing philosophical assumptions about the practice of grading and its relation to students' learning to write might be stated like this:
> 
> > Learning to write or improve students' writing requires teachers to *judge writing quality*, thus course grades should be calculated by those judgements of quality. To be a fair assessment ecology, consistent judgements of quality are central.
>
> versus
>
> > Learning to write or improving students' writing requires students to *produce a certain quantity* of writing, thus course grades should be calculated by the quantity of writing a student produces. To be a fair assessment ecology, consistent judgements of quantity are central.
> 
> [page 64]

> As mentioned already, [[2009 Danielewicz & Elbow|Danielewicz and Elbow]] describe their contract as a hybrid model, one that uses both kinds of judgement to produce various kinds of grades. Judgements of quantity are used to calculate course grades up to a B, while judgements of quality are used for those above a B. I found in my own classrooms that hybrid contracts like [[2009 Danielewicz & Elbow|Danielewicz and Elbow]]'s were unfair and white supremacist because they changed the rules of the game in the last inning, when the score was tied and there was a runner on third. [page 64--65]

> I decided to try to figure out how I might use quantity judgments only in all contract grade distinctions. There is some literature that supports this kind of assessment ecology, which I began to look at more carefully. In 1976, [[John V. Knapp]] offered a version of a quantity system to produce course grades, a grading system in which students receive a simple binary judgment on drafts, acceptable or unacceptable ([[1976 Knapp|Knapp 651]]). Once a draft is deemed acceptable, the student may move on to the next essay in the class. If they don't want to keep trying, they abandon that essay and move to a new essay. There are eight essays assigned, and over the course of the semester, students acquire as many acceptable drafts as possible, with three to four giving the student a C course grade, five to six a B, and seven to eight an A. The more writing a student accomplishes in Knapp’s system, the higher their grade. While Knapp’s system avoids the teacher making too many judgments of quality on individual drafts---he only makes a single, binary one on any given piece of writing---it still uses judgments of quality by a single teacher. It is still a hybrid model. It avoids most ranking that occurs in grading and point systems, but ultimately maintains a hierarchical system of quality based on the teacher’s idiosyncratic DAD, which categorizes students into acceptable and unacceptable. Any labor put forth by the student will not do. It must be labor that equates to an acceptable draft judged by the teacher. Knapp’s system too easily works from an unquestioned, dominant white racial habitus that informs the dispositions to language that writing teachers always carry with them, no matter their intentions or who they are. The foundation of those simple binary judgments of quality that Knapp uses to make judgments of quantity is still white supremacist. His system, like the hybrid contract, protects the white center, the white literacy property, and creates unspoken inner dikes. [page 65]

[[Knapp's assessment ecology is a hybrid grading system that uses judgements of writing quality to produce a grade, albeit minimal]]

> seems a fairer system, one that rewards those who do more work in the class. And those judgments of quality that he does make have a low threshold. In order to pass, a paper just has to meet minimum quality standards according to the teacher. And yet, everyone's labor is not equal in this system. A multilingual student working 10 hours on an essay may not meet the minimum standard for a passing essay, yet a white, middle-class student, who was raised in a monolingual English home, might spend five hours on the same essay, achieving a pass and moving on. Because the teacher's judgments of quality are what determines whether any draft is acceptable or not in the system, some students may still not be able to achieve a high grade, even if they desire to and are willing to work extra hard. To draw on [[John Rawls]]' idea of "justice as fairness," I wasn't convinced that a system that depended on my own judgments of minimum quality of drafts, which was by default comparisons to a dominant white racial habitus, gave all students a "fair equality of opportunity" ([[2001 Rawls|43]]). I realized that in a hybrid contract, judgments of quality protect the white center of literacy as white property [page 66]

In [[ESI-024 (Course)]], students are taught grammar and rhetoric from HOWL, but that doesn't mean I need to enforce HOWL entirely.

> Rawls explains that "fair equality of opportunity" means that opportunities in a society or system are (1) formally open to all, and (2) "that all should have a fair chance to attain them" (43). I realize the critiques of Rawls' theory of social justice by scholars such as [[Iris Young]] who argue for more structural understandings of fairness, but I think taken on its own, this bit of Rawlsian theory holds up as structural [page 66]

He doesn't say it directly here, but knowing what we know about the [[Developmental Sequences in SLA]] and how long it takes ([[1989 Collier]]); this is a good argument for radically changing gateway EAP courses in universities that have a statement of diversity and inclusion.

Like the equality vs. equity picture ([[@2016maguire_illustrating]]); though there have been some criticisms of it which apply here ([[2018 Sippin the EquiTEA]], [[2018 Mind Reader]]).

> quantity doesn't necessarily equate to time spent laboring over a draft. Some people are faster at producing a lot of text, some are slow typists, some pine over every sentence, some just throw every word in their head down on paper, piling up pages quickly. There is lots to unpack here: we aren't simply talking about quantity or quality, but my judgements of such things. [page 67]

> What about students who have other demands on their time, intersections of class and economics, intersections that surely played a role in my own background? Aren't there students who likely don't have to work and go to school at the same time? Won't they be just as privileged in a purely labor-based grading system where arguably time is the key factor for success as in typical quality-based systems of grading? [page 69]

This is particularly an issue for resident immigrant ESL students.

> Unlike [[2009 Danielewicz & Elbow|Danielewicz and Elbow's hybrid contract]], which uses only quality judgments for grades above the default B grade, [[2003 Reichert|Reichart's]] uses quality judgments together for all grade distinctions. Her system is similar to [[1976 Knapp|Knapp's]], only more explicit about what counts as minimum quality. [[2003 Reichert|Reichart's contract]] attempts to be clear about the fact that in order for a draft to be complete and count, even if a student is just trying to do the minimum, it must meet a particular set of quality standards. These standards though are still based on dominant white racial habitus and standards of "good writing" determined and judged by the teacher. How can these kinds of binary judgments be done in such a way that check my own version of a white racial habitus and discursive biases, while still using them because they're the main ones I have to judge language? One early discussion that was particularly helpful in solving this quality vs quantity problem was [[Barrett John Mandel]]'s "[[1973 Mandel|Teaching Without Judging]]," which was published in College English in 1973. Essentially, [[1973 Mandel|Mandel's system]] is one based on quantity of work completed by students. If a student wants a C in the class, they attend class regularly and turn in a complete C-level essay. The designation "C-level" refers to the requirements of the essay, not Mandel's judgment of quality. For Mandel, C-level work was a collaboratively written draft that students wrote and submitted. If an individual student wanted a B in the course, then they turned in B-level work. The range of B-level work Mandel listed were things such as "an intellectual journal covering the course readings and the class itself. Due twice: mid-term and end of the term," or "close analysis of one play (if the analysis differs from that which evolve in class discussion). Due any time" ([[1973 Mandel|Mandel 629]]). So to get a higher grade, Mandel's contract asked students simply to do more work in the class. What I took from Mandel's system was the idea of a contract that used only judgments of quantity, not quality, to determine all course grades. The more work or labor a student does for the class, the higher their grade should be. [page 68--69]

> > I will, theoretically, accept trash submitted for an "A". But I believe that in a non-judgmental, unpunitive, encouraging context, students will want to work toward achieving selfstyled and often very challenging goals. While nothing in the format of the course coerces a student to do anything which reason, energetic teaching, and the student's native curiosity do not inspire, I, needless to say, constantly encourage self-discipline and self-respecting work. ([[1973 Mandel|629]]; emphasis in original) [page 69]

> Mandel calls this having "faith in students," which he admits is easier for him than many other teachers ([[1973 Mandel|629]]). On occasion, he says, he gets the "rushed or careless junk. But [his] approach to teaching is geared to those who can and want to learn, no[t] to those who, for reasons they are entitled to, cannot avail themselves to the opportunities to learn" ([[1973 Mandel|629-30]]). In short, Mandel designed his assessment ecology around students who are willing to have faith in the ecology and in themselves to learn. He feels no need to keep his students in line, to force them to turn in writing of quality that he determines is acceptable, instead [[Barrett John Mandel|Mandel]]'s ecology assumes that students will want to form lines in the ways they know how, that they won't need to be held accountable since they can be responsible on their own. They want to learn and want to work [page 69]

[[Mandel's was an early iteration of labor-based grading contracts that emphasized having faith in students willingness to improve in an encouraging setting]]

Ask students to set a specific goal for each of the SLOs; reading, writing, grammar, vocabulary; after we discuss what that SLO means.

Oh! Students who are absent or more than 15 minutes late can just be required to come see me during office hours to make sure they don't fall behind. This policy *actually* tries to help rather than punish. [[End of semester review]]

>  This is how we all should be able to work with students, to labor together. I realize that all teachers may not be able or willing to try "energetic teaching" that inspires students to do "self-disciplined and self-respecting work," or that if we do attempt this kind of teaching, we could recognize such efforts by all students, or even that such energetic teaching will always lead to students responding in these ways. I also realize the problematic in notions of teaching that promote unquestioned ideas about students that just need freedom and encouragement to do what they want in order to really learn, yet classrooms require environments that encourage risks and learning through failure, doing what we can, not what others tell us to. While I think Mandel's system is not overly-idealistic about his students, I do realize that to many, it seems like pie-in-the-sky, dreamy pedagogy [page 70]

It seems pie-in-the-sky because we feel that our courses are expected to be (or even should be) gatekeeper classes; i.e., inner and outer dikes.

I thought there was a TED talk about the gatekeeping nature of ESL classes, but I might have had it confused with [[2010 Thompson]].

The opposing argument I'm interested in preparing a response to is "What about competencies?"

> Do grades motivate students? No, but they do force students, coerce them into doing things, which we usually read as motivation. Coercion is not motivation. Real motivation is doing something even when-- and usually when-- there is no extrinsic reward, when no one is watching. [page 70]

I think most scholars would argue that extrinsic motivation is still motivation, but I take his point.
[[Grades are a coercive mechanism that are often mistaken for intrinsic motivation]]
I wonder if pressing extrinsic motivations can override any potential for intrinsic motivation to develop. A good place to start would be [[1993 Amabile]] and [[2002 Vallerand & Ratelle]] and the topic of [[Motivation]].

> as [[Paulo Freire|Freire]] and [[Victor Villanueva|Villanueva]] remind us, part of literacy education is questioning how natural the natural is. [page 70]

> Invoking his "liberal role" in "the liberal arts" to justify his pedagogy, [[Barrett John Mandel|Mandel]] cites a student author from *[[Change Magazine|Change]]* magazine, who "lambasted her left-wing professors for shooting off their mouths about liberal, human values, and teaching in an atmosphere of stuffy, conservative self-deception." [[Barrett John Mandel|Mandel]] continues by quoting the student: "Don't speak of the liberation of the subjugated and then lower my grade because I hand in a paper late" ([[1973 Mandel|630]]). ... Our pedagogies and writing philosophies are warm, soft, social, and inviting, but our assessment ecologies are cold, hard, individualistic (even selfish) and discouraging. [page 71]

> This blindness or silence in conventional assessment ecologies is a product of whiteness. It is white blindness, or silence, that writing teachers too often have. It is an inability to recognize that we are controlling the rules of a racialized language game that allow us to win, asking (racialized) others to play, knowing that many cannot follow very easily the rules we've made that help us win, and by default make sure they lose, because as long as others keep losing, we win. Keep the barbarians in the outer dikes, or better yet, keep them out of all the dikes, goes the tacit logic of the system. [page 71]

> Now, one might think that a grading contract system that rewards the amount of work or writing done in a writing class instead of any judgments of quality on the teacher's part would not be very effective at helping the institutionally vulnerable students ... these are the very populations that benefit most from grading contracts. I conducted program-wide assessments of mostly labor-based grading contracts at [[Fresno State University|Fresno State]], which showed that most students of color actually do better in many dimensions of quality in final portfolios, and are happier with their writing experiences, feeling that the absence of grades helped them in their learning ([[2012 Inoue|Inoue, "Grading Contracts"]]). [[2014 Blackstock & Exton|Blackstock and Exton]] also found similar conclusions about hybrid grading contracts in community college and tribal college writing courses, where most of their "nontraditional students also largely fit the profile of ‘basic writers' elaborated by [[David Bartholomae]]'s book [[2016 Bartholomae|Writing on the Margins]]" ([[2014 Blackstock & Exton|279]]). In their surveying of students, they found that hybrid contracts helped their students because "[b]asic writers perceive that they do not have control over their writing skills, but they can usually control their ability to attend class, engage in academic activities, and complete assignments" ([[2014 Blackstock & Exton|284]]). [[2014 Blackstock & Exton|Blackstock and Exton]] use a similar contract as [[2009 Danielewicz & Elbow|Danielewicz and Elbow's]] and say that its shift from focusing on quality of products to the writing process was instrumental in helping their students find the contract helpful in their courses ([[2014 Blackstock & Exton|284]]). Like all hybrid grading contracts, [[2014 Blackstock & Exton|Blackstock and Exton]] also found some difficulties with the hybrid aspect of the contract. When discussing motivation, which often goes hand-in-hand with discussions about grades (e.g., if there are no grades, how will students be motivated to revise or turn in a polished draft?), they admit that students who were motivated by such things as grades and percentages will not be satisfied with a hybrid grading contract system. [page 72]

[[There are some concerns that students who are habitually motivated by grades do not do well in labor-based grading systems including hybrid grading contracts]]
[[There is some evidence that labor-based grading systems help vulnerable students learn better]]

>  Still, [[2014 Blackstock & Exton|they]] see problems and contradictions with so-called clearly articulated criteria for A-quality work in contracts and rubrics, saying that the "language is admittedly subjective and tends to raise more questions than it answers." So they "are moving toward adopting simple behavior criteria: students may earn an A by submitting additional drafts of the assigned essays" (289). In effect, [[2014 Blackstock & Exton|Blackstock and Exton]] appear to move toward a purely labor-based grading contract. [page 73]

> Words instead of grades. ... Learning instead of measuring. ... [[David Bleich]] called these things, "descriptive evaluation" ([[1997 Bleich|29]]), and even cites [[1968 Marshall|Max Marshall's 1968 book, *Teaching Without Grades*]]. [[Brain Huot]] called it "instructive evaluation" ([[2002 Huot|69]]). [page 73]

### Chapter 3: What is Labor in Labor-based Grading Contracts?
> This chapter theorizes labor as it pertains to writing classroom assessment ecologies. [page 75]

> The human brain uses 20% of the body's total energy expenditure, with two thirds of that energy going to cognitive processes of thinking, the electrical impulses that activate neurons ([[2008 Swaminantha|Swaminatha]]). [page 75]

[[The brain uses one fifth of the body's energy, and most of that just to power thinking]]

> This is what my labor-based grading contract assumes at its most basic level: to learn is to labor [page 75]

> I reference this work in the labor-based grading contract and the course's labor instructions for all assignments in a couple of ways, by time spent on a task or activity, and by the amount of words produced when writing (if the activity is a writing task) or the number of pages or words read (if the task is a reading one). [page 76]

[[In a labor-based ecology, writing can be measured by the number of words or pages produced and reading can be measured by the number of pages or words read]]

> I end the chapter on a short discussion of one consistent theme, seeing labor as a mindful practice that is important to students' learning. [page 76]

> all assessment ecologies are also political economies since not only is one main element of assessment ecologies power relations but they are also complex systems similar to political economies. [page 76]

> In many ways "ecology" and "economy" are interchangeable, at least in the way I refer to them in this chapter. Assessment ecologies, even ones that avoid giving grades, still are systems of exchange. In them, texts, ideas, judgments, and labor are exchanged. [[2010 Riddell et al.|Riddell, Shackelford, Stamos, and Schneider]] offer a good definition of political economy that seems easily applicable to any classroom assessment ecology if we replace "economic events" and "economic systems" with classroom assessment events and systems: 
> 
> > Political economy . . . is more concerned with the relationships of the economic system and its institutions to the rest of society and social development. It is sensitive to the influence of non-economic factors such as political and social institutions, morality, and ideology in determining economic events. It thus has a much broader focus than economics. (quot. in [[2013 Sackrey|Sackrey et al. 3-4]]) [page 76--77]

>  reader's judgments of a text say more about their own biases and values than they do about so-called quality of the text in question. This is one way to account for how the same text can be judged by the same person very differently at different times, when the ecology has changed or the influences in the system have changed. This also reveals the unevenness in classroom assessment economies. [page 77]

[[Judgements of writing quality say more about the reader's bias than the quality of the writing]]

> [[Tony Scott]] has discussed this second aspect in the political economy of writing classrooms, looking closely at the way students' lives in fast-capitalism intersect with their lives in the classroom. [[2009 Scott|Scott's pedagogy]] attempts to account better for the way working-class students tend to experience learning and college by focusing on the curricular theme of "work," giving students a chance to examine and interrogate work, labor, and their lives in relation to these things [page 77--78]

[[Working-class students have a better experience in learning when it is framed as work or labor]]

> In his own defining of political economy, [[Tony Scott|Scott]] emphases the way the concept calls attention to "the systemic/ideological and the particular/material" (15). His summing up of the concept is worth repeating: 
> 
> > Broad trends and political policies--- systems that organize and value human labor--- have profound effects on individuals; in turn, individual decisions and actions are what embody and enact those broad trends, policies, and systems. "Economy" isn't the sum total of a set of formulas or quantified indicators: those are only attempts to understand and describe a dynamic, codependent, evolving material entity. (16)
> 
> [page 78]

> All assessment systems use student labor in exchanges with other things of value, such as grades, essays, feedback, or learning products or outcomes, but typically labor is not a commodity, not the thing exchanged directly. [page 78]

> In labor-based grading contract ecologies, however, labor is an explicit commodity that is exchanged, making it more valuable and present (not ignored) in the system---thus, making it more valuable and valued in the economy [page 78]

[[Labor-based grading practices link assessment with pedagogy making them one in the same]]

> In fact, labor as a unit of exchange and value is the foundation of all classroom assessment economies, whether we pay attention to it or not. [page 79]

> To say that the writing classroom is a political economy is not a new position. [[John Trimbur]] offers a compelling argument for writing teachers to pay closer attention to the circulation of writing as a kind of commodity in classroom economies, although he's speaking more about the production of readings of cultural texts, like books, ads, etc., that are often discussed in writing classrooms. [[John Trimbur|Trimbur]] draws heavily on [[Karl Marx|Marx]]'s formulation of the process of production, distribution, exchange, and consumption found in Grundrisse. He concludes on two points. The first is that [[Karl Marx|Marx]]'s evaluation helps writing teachers see that in a classroom where student writing and readings of texts are circulated, "the question to begin with is not so much where the commodity goes as what it carries in its internal workings as it circulates." He continues, "the distribution of commodities [like cultural texts and student essays] cannot be understood apart from the distribution of the means of production" (209). Let me put this in different terms. In labor-based grading contract economies, the labor of reading, drafting, feedback from peers and teacher, and all the activities that go into producing and reading a draft, are circulated in a cycle of production and can be considered part of the process of production as well as distribution, exchange, and consumption. What gets circulated in this recursive cycle are various activities and abilities of different agents in the classroom, what I've referred to as habitus, all of which determine how the student essay is read and judged. When no grades are circulating in these cycles, only documents and judgments, then labor and its value become more prominent and important, and more obvious, assuming that everyone is willing to agree to give up having those grades on everything. Attention by people in the economy returns to the labor and what it produces. Trimbur concludes, "we cannot understand what is entailed when people encounter written texts without taking into account how the labor power embodied in the commodity form [like a commercial being analyzed by a class or peer feedback on an essay] articulates a mode of production and its prevailing social relations" (210). [page 79--80]

> Marx's words that one can exchange one's labor power for a time, but not one's labor, since the latter is connected to one's biological body and life. One may labor, but one has labor power to exchange in the marketplace. Hannah Arendt agrees with this notion of labor in her theorizing of labor as mainly biological, which I'll discuss later in this chapt [page 80]

[[Labor is connected to the physical body, whereas labor power is the combination of labor and time that a person can trade]]

> student's feedback on a colleague's draft accumulates value through the ways it is circulated in the assessment economy, through the labor done and encapsulated in the draft, its feedback, and other exchanges around the draft. Value is created and accumulated by that circulation. The engine of that circulation is the labor that students do. What is carried forward or exchanged in the system is labor power accumulated.  [page 81]

[[Labor power inherent in a writing assignment grows as it goes through the writing process]]

> Trimbur has broken ground on thinking about the Marxian articulations of labor and value in cycles of production, distribution, exchange, and consumption in writing classrooms. [page 81]

> In The Political Economy of Communication, Vincent Mosco also explains this etymology, concluding that "political economy therefore originated in the management of the family and political households" (23). So a classroom writing assessment economy calls attention to the various, diverse habitus of the people in the economy, and how we all are always situated in larger social systems, communities of diverse individuals who also fit into groups of people. The diverse habitus in the classroom are vital to the way the system functions to create and circulate value in labors. The value and nature of our labor as individuals is a function of our habitus in context, of who we are, where we come from, what dispositions we carry, where and how we work for the class, and so on. In some sense, this etymology reminds us of the interconnected domestic (personal) and social spheres that are managed simultaneously, that work together symbiotically, always by everyone. 
> 
> This blurring of public and private, market and home, agrees with Bradley A. Ault's discussion of oikos and the larger market economies in ancient Hellenic societies, which he describes as "coexistive" with each other (262). [page 82]

>  Ault shows how the private household was a center of commercial exchange, or at least interconnected to the larger commercial exchanges in the *agora*. [page 82]

[[The home ought to be a workshop that uses the family's labor power to produce goods for a market]]

> Labor-based grading contract economies highlight in a number of ways the interconnectedness of private and social practices (e.g., private labor and publicly circulated labor power) of students and teacher, of the private home and public market, of commodities' movement between these spheres, and of these spheres' relations to cycles of production, distribution, exchange, and consumption. [page 82]

>  In the political economy of a labor-based grading contract classroom, one's personal learning is consubstantial, interconnected to, everyone else's. Learning is only social. There is no private learning, no private judgments. This gives extra reason to consider compassion and something like the Charter for Compassion (discussed in Chapter 5) as central to understanding the meaning and significance of labor and labor power in classrooms since it asks students to labor for one another in communal ways. [page 83]

> In labor-based grading contract economies, the cycles of production, distribution, exchange, and consumption that constitute writing assessments are inextricably threaded with power, which makes labor and its value threaded with power relations as well. One important aspect of these power relations are the habitus of the people involved and where those habitus are in relation to a dominant standard or to others in the classroom. When used as the standard, dominant white racial habitus determine the power relations in classroom assessment economies. But in labor-based economies, attention is called to these power relations (and habitus), allowing them to be more easily seen and interrogated. Additionally, one habitus is not privileged as the standard, instead amount or quantity of labor determines grades---labor power becomes more important. This means that much like Marx's critique of capitalist systems, the point in more liberatory political systems is to give as many people as possible control over the means of production. In this case, I'm referring to the means to produce value in and around writing and reading practices, or around students' labors of learning, which amount to the production of course grades. Liberation, then, comes from the ways students' labor power is circulated as a commodity. [page 83]

Just as [[Capitalist societies devalue labor power in favor of capital to gain an advantage over a population]]; [[Conventional assessment ecologies value habitus more than learning]] The solution to both is to restore the value of labor power.

> > The word value, it is to be observed, has two different meanings, and sometimes expresses the utility of some particular object, and sometimes the power of purchasing other goods which the possession of that object conveys. The one may be called "value in use"; the other, "value in exchange." The things which have the greatest value in use have frequently little or no value in exchange; and, on the contrary, those which have the greatest value in exchange have frequently little or no value in use. Nothing is more useful than water: but it will purchase scarce anything; scarce anything can be had in exchange for it. A diamond, on the contrary, has scarce any value in use; but a very great quantity of other goods may frequently be had in exchange for it. (Smith n. pag.)

> Laura LaHaye in the Concise Encyclopedia of Economics provides this definition of mercantilism: "Mercantilism is economic nationalism for the purpose of building a wealthy and powerful state. Adam Smith coined the term ‘mercantile system' to describe the system of political economy that sought to enrich the country by restraining imports and encouraging exports." Book IV of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations offers an extensive treatment of his notion of the mercantile system. [page 83]

> It is in this more than quality that we might see the contradiction in use- and exchange-values. One might see a similar gap in a student's hard work on a draft that receives a lower than expected grade. To the student, the labor and draft may have accumulated more value than the grade suggests. [page 85]

I think he uses contradiction very loosely. Very long-winded way of saying this.

> Grades have no exchange-value because they are not used in a labor-based system. Theoretically, the use of my feedback on a draft to a student might be measured in the degree or extent that the student can use that feedback in future work on the draft or for the class. Its exchange-value is linked to those uses. If there are several other assignments in which the student must use my feedback in some way, say discuss them with me, create a revision plan, or pose problems about the judgments I make on their draft, then my feedback is highly exchangeable because it is highly useful, but not necessarily outside of the classroom, at least not directly. However, in all economies, use- and exchange-value for a commodity rarely match up perfectly. Commodities often have different use- and exchange-values simultaneously. This simple distinction between use- and exchange-value in a classroom assessment economy helps us see why students might find a teacher's feedback or grade mostly useless (having little use-value) in the class, which might lead them to do nothing with that feedback, or see the grade as simply the only thing that is important. However, they may also know that they need to accumulate high grades in the class because of the higher exchange-value those grades purchase after the course is over, through their translation into a higher course grade. The classroom's assessment economy sets up these different use- and exchange-values. [page 85--86]

> How exactly is the classroom's assessment economy constructing high use-values for all the commodities it circulates? The bottom line is that the two kinds of value are interconnected, so the gap is not an equivocation but a paradox created by the political economy in which that commodity and value circulate. [page 86]

> In capitalist markets such as today, the gap between use- and exchange-value appears more evident because value is usually measured in monetary ways, which is one level removed from the measurements of use, and more importantly from desire and aesthetic, emotional, and ethical considerations from which people actually operate, which I'll call a commodity's actual worth. Worth varies by person, and is measured in a multitude of ways, not just by possible use but also by aesthetic appreciation, how a commodity makes one feel, by our desire for the commodity, and by our moral or ethical associations around the commodity, all of which are not the same as need or use. This unaccounted for aspect of value, what I'm naming worth, helps name the contradiction that Trimbur points out in his discussion of use- and exchange-value. 
> 
> Trimbur identifies the contradiction's source in the way that the capitalist mode of production "reproduces the prevailing and contradictory social and economic relations . . . where socialized production, with its promise of overcoming material scarcity, is at odds with the goal of private profit" (208). He offers a systematic way of understanding the gap, the contradiction. I argue that part of this contradiction in the capitalist mode of production is that it doesn't account for worth (or value produced by desire that is linked to ethical, emotional, and aesthetic dimensions), yet worth is a part of the judgments we make that lead to production, distribution, exchange, and consumption of all commodities. [page 86]

>  The bodily emotional responses we have to commodities, including the value we place on our labor power, affect our desires for them, or our feelings about them. This is an individualistic way to understand how these contradictions or gaps are created that is also systemic or structural. [page 86]

> In Chapter 16 of Life of Perikles, Plutarch writes of Pericles: 
> 
> > As to his paternal estate, he was loth to lose it, and still more to be troubled with the management of it; consequently, he adopted what seemed to him the simplest and most exact method of dealing with it. Every year's produce was sold all together, and with the money thus obtained, he would buy what was necessary for his household in the market, and thus regulate his expenditure. (n. pag.) 
>
> Apparently, Plutarch reports that Pericles' family was not very happy about his practice of exchanging the surplus commodities of his household into money every year. As Plutarch explains in the same passage, the women and sons of his family found Pericles a poor manager of the household, and "blamed his exact regulation of his daily expenses, which allowed none of the superfluities common in great and wealthy households, but which made the debit and credit exactly balance each other." The tension in Pericles' household economy occurred because of his practice of translating the household's commodities into monetary exchange-value and managing only that value.  [page 88]

In contrast to today where almost no households produce anything at all (except labor power). We're consumers.

> Scarcity does not fully account for the gap between use- and exchange-value because it doesn't account fully for demand, which can be a product of contingent and rhetorically influenced judgments. We trade in exchange-value. We live and experience use-value, but we are motivated by desire, by the worth of things, which is often communicated rhetorically. 
> 
> This is why advertising is so important in capitalism. Fast-capitalism isn't that interested in communicating commodities' use-value, or even exchange-value, but it is very interested in manufacturing desire. Desire, the advertising industry knows, creates worth, which can operate outside of or in contradiction to use- or exchange-values. In fact, advertising is most successful when worth is more than exchange-value, and exchange-value is more than use-value---in other words, when it can produce lots of desire for a commodity, and charge inflated prices for the commodity, despite its much lower use-value. This illustrates the central importance of worth in all political economies, including assessment economies. [page 89]

> In The Theory of the Leisure Class, Thorstein Veblen offers a way to understand how worth is generated in political economies in his famous theory of conspicuous consumption. He argues that those classes of people who can afford to will buy the most expensive clothing, accoutrements, houses, food, etc., they can because "the consumption of these more excellent goods is an evidence to wealth, it becomes honorific . . . the failure to consume in due quantity and quality becomes a mark of inferiority and demerit" (64). [page 89]

> Veblen's theory suggests one important aspect most applicable to the writing classroom. The commodities of value we exchange, like papers and feedback, which encapsulate our labor power, are associated with our own value and worth as individuals. Criticize my paper and you criticize me to some extent, or it feels like that.  [page 89]

> But one might argue that grades are meant to equate to merit, and a student doesn't wear their grade on their body. Or do they?17Grades on writing equate to one judge's comparison to a white racial habitus embodied in a local dominant set of discursive standards understood by that judge. Haswell's categorization theory explains this well, which I discussed in Chapter 2. So grades have a difficult time being a reliable measure of quality or value, especially if the student in question comes to the classroom with a different habitus than the one embodied in the standard. This is often the case with working-class students, students of color, multilingual students, among others. Often times, grades do not equate to merit, or worth, at all, or merit and worth are equated falsely to only a dominant white racial habitus. In reality and experience, any valuing of student writing, then is a problematic, a set of problems that could (and likely should) be posed by and with the student, in order to understand the contradictions in how their writing is valued. [page 90]

> The urge is always to produce more, to buy more, to make more profit. But why do we work from a principle of more consumption, and consumption at the highest exchange-value? One possible reason is offered by Max Weber in The Protestant Ethic and the "Spirit" of Capitalism, written just a few years after Veblen's theory (1905). Weber argues that the Protestant work ethic was influential in the rise and dominance of capitalism in the US. Values like labor or work as a "calling" or as an "end in itself" came from Calvinist doctrine that then encouraged or agreed with capitalist modes of production (19). What happens, according to Weber, is that such a Protestant ethic turns into a "spirit" of capitalism that favors profit for profit's sake (21). The best calling for one's life is to labor in order to make money--- or rather, one shows one's hard work, merit, and worth through the money one has made---but the focus is on the signs of election, of merit, the conspicuousness of making money. And this economic system favors those who control the means of production, capitalists, not the people laboring. [page 89]

>  Bourdieu's theory of habitus suggests that students might very well display dispositions that are read in determined ways. I've made a similar argument for "racial habitus" in assessment ecologies in Chapter 1 of Antiracist Writing Assessment Ecologies. [page 90]

> desires for high grades and desires to please the teacher (or receive favorable judgments of their writing by teachers). These desires raise the worth students place on grades as commodities. This conflates exchange-value of those grades with worth (learning and meaning), and this conflation of exchange-value and worth is central to how conspicuous consumption and the spirit of capitalism work [page 91]

> many students of color, multilingual students, or students whose habitus do not easily fit into those habitus expected in the writing classroom, namely white, middle-class habitus. These dominant white racial habitus become what is desired because the assessment economies, who are controlled by teachers and school administrators, set them up as most exchangeable through curricula and learning outcomes. Dominant white racial habitus have a high use-value in the academy and other markets, but again, people often confuse exchange-value with worth. And forget that use-value is constantly evolving and only a product of the labors and exchanges of people in the economy. You cannot change what is useful until you introduce something else useful. The system doesn't change without actual differences, contradictions, disturbances, without circulating what was previously undesirable or unknown. 
> 
> Veblen's conspicuous consumption theory fits well with Weber's ideas around the Protestant work ethic and its fueling of the spirit of capitalism in the US. One is not worthy unless one can show one's worth. And what signs of value and worth are offered in a capitalist society? Signs of the consumption of commodities, particularly ones with high exchange-values, like high grades. But this is only the story told to laborers and students in their respective political economies. Acquiring such signs of value and worth benefit most those with the most control and power in the economic system, capitalists and teachers, not those laboring for a wage or a grade. [page 91--92]

> the signs of merit and worth are mostly out of reach for many of our students whose habitus do not agree with the dominant white habitus of the academy. In these ways, teachers control students by controlling the signs of worth and value, which control students' labor without much regard for how much labor is expended in any individual case. This is because the signs of worth are controlled by the labor power perceived by the teacher that are encapsulated in documents and drafts and judged by comparing them to a single white, middle-class standard. [page 92]

> As I discussed in Chapter 5 under the question, "How can a teacher respond to students who put in minimal engagement in the labor, or try to game the system?" people learn exactly what they are able to at that moment in their lives. Forcing students to do otherwise is often futile, and may cause them to resist even more, turning them away from the very practices and ideas that we want for our students [page 92]

> The labor-based grading economy I'm arguing for defines and circulates exchange-value as the ways it determines when a student has done what they were asked to do. Did the student complete all the words asked of them and submitted in the manner asked? Simultaneously, use-value would be articulated and circulated through the material labor done in the present moment, and articulated in reflective documents and practices (e.g., journals, reflection practices, labor tweets, and labor logs). Worth would be felt and understood through reflections and metacognitive work that articulates the meaning and significance of the labor power encapsulated in classroom commodities. It is realized and understood in periodic and focused reflective practices. In this way, a labor-based assessment economy can circulate use-value, exchange-value, and worth separately to students' advantages, while still maintaining their interconnection or relationships to one another.  [page 93--94]

![[2022inoue-clip-labor.png]]

> worth focuses attention on the value of past labor in order to consider future labor practices. It is measured discursively in reflective documents and activities, and can be understood by asking, what is the meaning or significance of the labor or labor power already circulated or accumulated in the present document or activity? [page 95]

> Understanding labor in the above ways keeps separate the ways a course grade is calculated (exchange-value) from how a student accomplishes labor and uses it to further their immediate needs in the classroom (use-value), from the lessons and practices learned through reflections on their labor (worth). [page 95]

Parallels to how capitalist labor markets devalue "unskilled labor" --- classroom labor markets devalue not-HOWL.

> > What everything is really worth to the man who has acquired it, and who wants to dispose of it or exchange it for something else, is the toil and trouble which it can save to himself, and which it can impose upon other people. [...] That money or those goods indeed save us this toil. [page 96]

> So, according to Smith, labor is the common denominator of all value, no matter the kind. And value is determined in large part by the "quantity of labor" encapsulated in a commodity. This, I think, is intuitively true for learning in the writing classroom at all levels. But what does Smith mean by quantity? How do we measure the exchange-value of labor? It wasn't hours of labor put into the production of a commodity. Smith saw this as too abstract, since things like skill of laborers or the fertility of land vary too greatly. We can see this problem in the writing classroom, where one student's writing practices may produce more or a different quality of writing than another student's labor given the same constraints of time and information. [page 96]

> Smith. He says: "though equal quantities of labour are always of equal value to the labourer, yet to the person who employs him they appear sometimes to be of greater and sometimes of smaller value . . . In reality, however, it is the goods which are cheap in the one case, and dear in the other" (n. pag.; my emphasis). Thus, according to Smith's theory of value, measuring labor by time encapsulated in a commodity is difficult because it is always relative to the laborer’s skill or other material conditions that may constrain or aid the laborer in their tasks.  [page 96--97]

Students have a few mandatory writing assignments, but will also submit weekly writing journal assignments where they pick a topic based on something they've read recently. But be sure they understand the impact of plagiarism)

> We have the same problem in writing classrooms. Time spent on literacy tasks, like reading a text or writing a draft, as a way to measure quality of those tasks' outcomes, is difficult to use as a consistent method for determining grades. Students are not the same, and given the same time parameters will not produce writing of the same quality, meaning their literacies produce drafts that are judged by readers to be different. They will also not produce the same amount of text. Furthermore, they each likely will explain what they learned through the activities of writing differently. These differences across various students and between the quality, quantity, and learning within a single student's experience are the gaps between use-value, exchange-value, and worth. [page 97]

This point was made earlier in more direct terms. Students have different levels of proficiency with HOWL to begin with. [[@2016maguire_illustrating]] [[2018 Mind Reader]]

> Note that Smith and even Marx assumed that the purpose of capitalist economies was to produce excess exchange value so that capital could be accumulated. [page 98]

>  This unfairness in the economy, that one person's labor-time can produce more value than another's, is only unfair if the purpose of the economy is to accumulate and circulate exchange-value, such as money or grades, and if there is an agreed-upon standard by which to judge the products of labor. This is the case in capitalist economies and conventional, quality-based grading economies. [page 98]

fair and consistent; valid and reliable

> However, in the writing classroom, where our purposes are to accumulate learning, knowledge, practices, ideas, and literacy, it is reasonable to say that our primary purpose for our classroom assessment economies is the circulation and accumulation of labor's worth.  [page 98]

> This means that the value of labor measured by time on task or amount of text read or written, can be a fair measure of exchange-value, since exchange-value of labor is not connected to the circulation of worth, and worth is circulated more so in the economy. In short, the measures of exchange-value (i.e., grades) are circulated separately from the measures of worth (e.g., learning, focused reflections, feelings about the work, etc.). In the pursuit of accumulating worth in/through labor, students produce exchange-value by default, which is measured in uniform ways and separated from use-value and worth in the economy. [page 98]

[[Would teachers make more or less money if they worked independently of a school]]

> getting an advantage, getting labor cheaper and cheaper. For capitalist markets, the purpose is to accumulate capital, but this purpose does not equate well to any writing assessment economy. Our purposes are to learn how to read and write in particular ways, or to do them more critically. What we accumulate, then, in labor-based grading contract economies is individual worth, since it embodies what one has learned and what one can transfer after the course is over. Since exchange-value is separated from worth, using labor-time as a measure of labor can be a fair method, if we don't place judgments of quality on that labor-time---that is, if we keep the exchange-value separated from use-value and worth. In short, for the purposes of course grading, everyone's time is of equal exchange-value in the assessment economy, even though that same labor's use-value or worth may not be measured the same. [page 101]

[[Capitalist frameworks don't work in markets where the focus is on use-value and worth]]

> In short, some only have their labor power to exchange as a commodity, but do not get to control the exchange-value of that labor power. Power relations, who controls more of the conditions of labor, matters and places an entire group of labors in a weaker position, thus they are more often taken advantage of or exploited. And commodities' exchange-values are based on the materialized labor embodied in them, no matter their use or worth. This is part of the contradiction that Trimbur discusses (208), one that promises profits and the distribution of commodities and contradictorily reproduces an uneven (unfair) relation of power between the laboring classes and the valuing of their own labor, which is to say that laborers don't completely dictate their wages [page 101]

On the surface, this premise doesn't hold in ELA courses, but there are students with varying access to a university habitus-- some go to university in their home country; some have family who did.

> These uneven labor conditions create unfair, racist, and white supremacist outcomes. Students have varying degrees of limited to no control over the exchange-values (grades) of the commodities they produce by their labor, such as drafts they write, except to put more and more labor-time into documents, which may not amount to a better grade. For many multilingual and students of color, or students who come with different habitus than those that inform the dominant discourse of the classroom, more time does not always equal more exchange-value in a draft. [page 101--102]

> (Marx, Theories of Surplus-Value n. pag.). Marx understood that the value of labor, how one agent might judge it, is not the same as the quantity of labor, or labor-time.
> 
> Thus, one ethical problem with capitalist political economic systems is that laborers do not control the value of their labor, capitalists do, and this creates unfair gaps among exchange- and use-value of one's labor power accumulated in commodities, increases capital accumulation for capitalists and decreases them for laborers.  [page 102]

>  Marx comes to his critique. He says that Smith "confuses the labour of other people with the produce of this labour" (emphasis in original). Thus the exchange-value of a commodity is equal to the quantity of other people's labor materialized in that commodity, according to Marx. He explains: 
>  
>  > It [sic] emphasis here is on the change brought about by the division of labour: that is to say, that wealth no longer consists in the product of one's own labour, but in the quantity of the labour of others which this product commands, the social labour which it can buy, the quantity of which is determined by the quantity of labour it itself contains. In fact, only the concept of exchange-value is here involved ---that my labour now counts only as social labour, and consequently its product determines my wealth by its command over an equal quantity of social labour . . . The emphasis here lies on the equalisation, brought about through the division of labour and exchange-value, of my labour with the labour of others, in other words, with social labour (the fact that my labour too, or the labour contained in my commodities, is already socially determined, and has fundamentally changed its character, escapes Adam), and not at all on the difference between materialised labour and living labour, and the specific laws of their exchange. (Marx, Theories of Surplus-Value n. pag.; emphasis in original) [page 102--103]

[[Workers in a capitalist system lose at both ends of the market equation]]

> labor power is different from materialized and living labor, since labor power is what is accumulated and exchanged through a commodity in the market. It is accumulated through circulation. Consider the way a house gains in value between each sale. [page 103]

> living labor is what people do to live and produce, to learn and be human, which I associate to use-value of labor [page 103]

> measuring labor in a labor-based grading economy can be done in three separate ways, three different measures that are dictated by why we are measuring labor in those three ways.  [page 104]

> First, we measure to produce an institutionally demanded course grade, which requires a numerical number that is fair and whose standard of measurement is agreed upon by everyone in the classroom. This is the exchange-value of students' labor. Second, we measure labor by its usefulness to students in their learning and development in the course  [page 104]

> This can be done by some quantitative measures like engagement ratings on individual labor sessions, but primarily is done through frequent, even daily, personal reflections on labor.  [page 104]

>Finally, we measure worth of labor by articulating the significance and meaning that we find in our present and past labors of the class. This is done by reflections on labor patterns and labor data that we keep throughout the quarter or semester. These reflections, which are done at crucial times in the quarter or semester (e.g., midpoint and final), determine or articulate worth of labor to the individual student [page 104]

>  But to do this work, the standards of the measurement of exchange- and use-value must be negotiated and agreed upon with students, so that those who labor and have the most stake in the economy, those who are meant to benefit most from the purposes of the assessment economy, can have more control over the value of their labor, and the meaning of their labor's worth. These power relations make labor-based grading contract economies fairer and more socially just. They allow any classroom assessment economy to respond directly to the local diversity and contexts in any classroom. [page 104]

> The three dimensions of labor are: 
> 
> - How students labor, measured by explaining the step-by-step process of labor involved in any practice or assignment through labor instructions and student reflections on labor. It is most associated to the use-value of labor. This dimension answers the question: How am I laboring and what does it offer me? [page 105]

Weekly paragraph writing assignments journal

> - That students labor, measured by the quantity of student labor in time on tasks, number of words or pages, or duration of practices and activities most often recorded in labor logs and labor journals. It is most associated with the exchange-value of labor. This dimension answers: How much am I laboring? [page 105]

For reading, ReadTheory takes care of this.
Writing - the writing assignments, draft word counts, etc.

> - What the labor means, measured by reflections on noncognitive and metacognitive domains through engagement ratings and mindful practices that help students pay attention to their labor in order to make sense and meaning of it, done often in labor logs, labor journals, labor tweets, and midterm and final reflections on their labor as a practice. It is most associated to labor's worth. This dimension answers: What is the nature of my labor and what do I learn from it? [page 105]

This can be weekly emails of labor logs.

> also illustrate the order in which I ask students to pay attention to their labor, which offers a slow, deepening, and cumulative sense of their labors in the process of any assignment and through the course of the semester or quarter. We begin with discussing and running through the process of the labor instructions (the how of labor) for an assignment. Each set of labor instructions emphasizes clearly what they are supposed to do, step by step, helping students see exactly how they might labor. As they do the actual labor, they keep track of the amount of time in the labor, with cues from me at each step that explain how much approximate time each step should take or how many words are expected of them to produce (if writing is the labor) or read (if reading is the labor) (the that of labor). [page 106]

> One doesn't learn to write by turning in a finished paper. One learns in the labors of researching, drafting, and revising---in the doing---and learns best if one pays attention to how one is doing those labors. [page 106]

He keeps making this argument, but I worry that its disingenuous. No one thinks that learning happens when we turn the paper in; we assume that because they turned a paper in, that they learned how to do it. And this assumption is still present in his labor-based approach because we would have to assume that students did the labor when they wrote the reflections and logs of it. I suppose this does have the benefit of making it more steps if a student were to fabricate it; and it also makes it harder to take shortcuts. It fully encourages the student to engage.

> Once a week, we complete this reflecting on what their labor means by making entries into their labor journals. Finally, during midpoint and final times, students reflect upon all the data they've gathered up to that point, looking for patterns and other things they are learning about their labor as a set of practices. I prompt students with questions about patterns and the contradictions between apparent use- and exchange-values.  [page 106]

> Beyond these somewhat practical reasons for thinking of labor in three dimensions, labor is also a vital part of the material conditions of all life, making it important to pay attention to in educational processes, especially literacy education, which often is understood as learning to be a citizen or becoming critically aware of one's self and one's world. [page 107]

> The Human Condition, Hannah Arendt [...] The human condition of labor is life itself" (7). Work, then, is activity that is "unnatural" yet "provides an ‘artificial' world of things, distinctly different from all natural surroundings . . . The human condition of work is worldliness" (7). Finally, action "goes on directly between men without the intermediary of things or matter, corresponds to the human condition of plurality, to the fact that men, not Man, live on earth and inhabit the world". [page 107]

>  James Berlin identifies the purpose for writing instruction in the twentieth century as preparing citizens (189), while ancient Hellenic education was explicitly about preparing citizens for their duties as citizens (Marrou), something George Kennedy's history of classical rhetoric shows as well. [page 107]

The direction of much adult literacy education for immigrants is preparing them for duties as workers more so than as citizens. see WIOA

> > Labor assures not only individual survival, but the life of the species. Work and its product, the human artifact, bestow a measure of permanence and durability upon the futility of mortal life and the fleeting character of human time. Action, in so far as it engages in founding and preserving political bodies, creates the condition of remembrance, that is, for history. (8-9) [page 107--108]

> So in Arendt's conception of the human condition, labor is biological and preserves life at its most fundamental level. Work identifies the material, the artifacts we produce, and provides some permanence and durability to our temporary and limited life, while action pertains to the political and historical trends and movements that are bigger than the individual, allowing societies to have memory and a sense of history by allowing what individuals do to continue on, contribute to larger things, and extend beyond their limited time on earth. 
> 
> I will not engage in a critique of Arendt's theory of the human condition, but I will voice my resistance to her hierarchy, which sets up an elitist, linear set of practices that devalue the biological (labor) and favor intellectual and political practices (action). It is reminiscent of Plato's hierarchy of souls or human types in Phaedrus, in which the very acts that Plato and Arendt are engaged in are the definition of the highest level in their respective hierarchies. Regardless of what one thinks of her hierarchy, Arendt offers some useful ways to consider labor, if we assume that labor references the biological and is always connected to both work and action. I do not want to separate the three concepts, but place them all under one category, labor. [page 108]

> We cannot have history (action) without the biological necessity of laboring bodies (labor), or the tools and artifacts that make our world and action possible (work).

> All these elements, which I call three-dimensional labor, are equally important and necessary for coming to critical consciousness about ourselves and our world, about meaningful and ethical language practices. [page 108]

> > All the European words for "labor," the Latin and English labor, the Greek ponos, the French travail, the German Arbeit, signify pain and effort and are also used for the pangs of birth. Labor has the same etymological root as labore ("to stumble under a burden"); ponos and Arbeit have the same etymological roots as "poverty" (penia in Greek and Armut in German). Even Hesiod, currently counted among the few defenders of labor in antiquity, put ponon alginoenta ("painful labor") as first of the evils plaguing man (Theogany 226). (48 [page 109]

>  People and the world are always in cycles of change, which can be seen in Plato's ideas about the soul and reincarnation in his Phaedrus. It is also a good way to characterize our students in their educational processes. They are always changing, fluxing, becoming. 
>  
>  The Pre-Socratic philosopher Heraclitus of Ephesus may be the most known for his ideas of life as constant flux. In two fragments misquoted by Plato (Cratylus, 402a),22 Heraclitus says: "[t]hose who step into the same river have different waters flowing ever upon them" (Freeman 25); and "[i]n the same river, we both step and do not step, we are and we are not" (Freeman 28). Daniel Graham explains the first fragment: "[t]he sentence says that different waters flow in rivers staying the same. In other words, though the waters are always changing, the rivers stay the same” (emphasis in original). [page 109--110]

> In the dialogue, Plato has Socrates say: "Heracleitus is supposed to say that all things are in motion and nothing at rest; he compares them to the stream of a river, and says that you cannot go into the same water twice." [page 109]

> If we accept the idea that life is flux, that change is essential to life, and that as Arendt says labor is a necessary part of the biological human condition, then labor does not deform bodies, it changes them in inevitable and necessary ways. Laboring is life. Suffering is part of laboring. And as the first of Buddhism's Four Noble Truths reminds us, life is suffering. Laboring is part of how change and flux happen. [page 110]

>  If we accept the ancient Hellenic doctrine of flux and unity of opposites, then one's status as an abled, woman, man, Asian, Black, or white person, for instance, is always in flux, just as those categories themselves are constantly and historically changing, as Omi and Winant explain about racial formations. Seeing the biological aspects of laboring as pain and misery is not cause to avoid it or devalue it, as Arendt appears to do, it is simply recognizing a natural part of the flux of life that inter-is our bodies. [page 110]

> Doing this in labor instructions can reveal how language is biological, how learning to read and write is never-ending and requires us to take time to move, to do things. A reading "assignment" is not simply a task to check off a list, not something done, a chapter swallowed or consumed, but it also designates a period of chronological time in which one's body is in laboring processes in particular material places. It is energy expended and time experienced that results in change. Reading a chapter, like writing a draft, is movement and flux. It is verbing, not a noun. [page 112]

> while I realize that many people separate work and play, I'm not sure that this separation is always useful or meaningful in an educational context, since as I've suggested above, learning languaging is part of the lifelong human condition. I do not deny that there are many grey areas in how we labor and play. And I think most would agree that oftentimes, labors that begin as work or for school, end up being fun and play, and vise versa. The distinctions between work, rest, and play seem fuzzy at best and mostly contrived, likely for the purposes of controlling people. If you can devalue play and make work more important in a society, then you can get a lot of people to define themselves by their work, by their laboring for an elite group, or a corporation. They will sacrifice themselves for their work. This, in effect, gets people to consent to modes of living that mostly benefit large corporations and their relatively few shareholders and CEOs. [page 113--114]

>  Did they write five hundred words? How many words did they write? Did they read for two hours? How many hours did they read exactly? Did they tweet a picture of an annotated page from their reading? In these ways, the second dimension of labor can help students conceive of time on task and the amount of words produced or read in a given labor session as instrumental to their learning and to understanding what that learning actually consists of. [page 115]

Share a picture of an annotated page from their reading.. I can do this for City Stories chapters (maybe not Your Choice) and put them in groups or have permanent teams to share out.

> She associates closely action with human diversity, individual distinctiveness and distinction. Action, according to Arendt, defines being human. [page 116]

>  I still offer more formal moments in the semester or quarter to think more carefully about their labor. The weekly reflections offer a series of low-stakes moments, as do our midterm and final reflections on our labor log data and labor journal entries. One move Arendt's action asks us to consider in such reflections is how the student is an agent acting in their labor. How does their labor make them? In what ways is that labor beginning some practice or bit of learning for them? Who are they just now beginning to become? What bit of meaning in their labor practices is worth sharing with their colleagues in class? What can be carried on, made larger than just some private insight for one student? These are hard, and arguably, abstract questions to pose to students, but asking students to think about themselves not only as individual students completing work for a class or teacher but as agents acting in purposeful ways that then begin the production of something else through their practices, something larger than themselves, can be a bit less abstract. 
>  
>  Such reflective activities or prompts might begin in the early weeks of a semester to focus on the student as an agent acting, deciding and doing things, in their labor, then gently push them to think about their words as deeds, and their deeds as words, push them to pose their own questions about what their labor means to their own development, to their own growth as a writer or reader. This making meaning of their labor may start with understanding the first dimension of labor: How did you do what you did? What happened first, second, etc.? Where were you? What was physically happening in your surroundings? It can then move to the second dimension: How long did you take to do key steps in the labor instructions? How much did you produce? At midpoint and final times, I ask them to reflect not on a single session of labor, but all their labor as a set of practices that stretch over the semester or quarter [page 116--117]

> Action participates and contributes to the larger community of people, so reflections that move students in that direction are shared with colleagues and fulfill the complete cycle of labor-work-action that Arendt articulates. In labor-based grading contract economies that use compassion as a key element in constructing the cultural space of judgment, sharing personal insights, making them communal theory about reading and writing, is compassionate behavior (I'll say more about this in Chapter 5), and opens up meaning and deeper learning by dramatizing the ways various students labor in diverse ways and share their theorizing from the dramas of their labors. It makes one's private reading labor, for example, also about helping others learn and do language acts too. [page 118]

> A fundamental aspect of labor-based grading contract economies is slowing down, experiencing labor and time differently, or mindfully. **I believe ==students usually learn best when they== can just be in the labor, when they can stop thinking so centrally about the end product or goal and ==center all of their energies and attention on the labor== they are engaged in right now.** [page 118]

> One might think of mindful laboring as the act of self-consciously laboring at something, doing something while simultaneously noticing that you are doing that work, that you are doing it in a particular way, that you feel a certain way as you do it, that that laboring makes you feel, see, hear, understand, and experience other things that are wrapped up in the labor. 
> 
> The institutional, historical, and pragmatic reasons for the fixation on the end-product are clear, and it's more than just about the writing classroom's heritage of product-based pedagogies, such as Berlin's Current-Traditional pedagogy. The focus on end-products in classrooms stems from the ways that classroom assessment economies function, how most are set up to produce a grade, an exchange-value, and pay little formal attention to the nuanced and contradictory meanings of the use-value and worth of labor. When most of the value and worth of students' labor is neglected, students themselves neglect it and are not in the practice of seeing it, or noticing that they labor, especially while they are in the act of laboring. Labor is usually something to get through, to be done with, not to savor. We try to do as little laboring as possible and produce the most product from that laboring. This is exactly the wrong way to learn literacies. [page 118--119]

Ask students how they feel when they study, read, or write.

SLA and CogSci supports this-- the act of remembering is what strengthens the neural pathways that make up our knowledge and habits.

Ask CogSci reddit: What's the neurological difference between habits and knowledge? Are they the same? 

LBG works well in Comp and similar because there aren't as concrete outcomes-- its incredibly subjective and therefore the labor-time itself can be a useful measure. Similar to "I've been studying/researching rhetoric for x years." it doesn't work as well with less subjective areas of learning-- but the point made about the value of labor is very true and important.

> Labor logs, labor journals, and labor tweets help make labor more present, more obvious, more there, so that students can begin to investigate it, and this allows the class to also use it as a fairer way to calculate course grades than judgments of so-called quality on products of their labors, commodities that inherently are valued in contradictory ways. [page 119]

> When discussing how to meditate and form contemplative practices, Arthur Zajoc, a physicist, argues that one cannot meditate fast. It always happens at the speed of breath and heartbeat. It cannot be rushed. He explains: Whether beholding a painting or listening to music, whether reading poetry or viewing a play, time must slow down in order for us to enter into the object of our attention with our heart as well as our head. If our thinking runs along with the worries of the day, or presses too forcefully, we remain outside the art of the painting, poetry, or performance. (51) [page 119--120]

> Zajoc is drawing on a set of contemplative practices, which have been used to help students learn in various disciplines (Barbezat and Bush). Contemplative practices help practitioners slow time down, or experience it as slower, enter objects of contemplation, such as our own breath, our bodies, an orange slice, a peanut, a picture or painting, a musical composition, the sensation of our feet in shoes or walking. Once entered, the practitioner explores the object of contemplation, feels as much as they can without judging themselves for not doing enough or experiencing something they think they should have. 
> 
> I posit that our grading economies in classrooms should be more like the beholding activities Zajoc references.  [page 120]

> Daniel Barbezat and Mirabai Bush tell us in their discussion of the practice for college classrooms that beholding has a recent tradition in art history (149). Beauty, as in art, requires that we keep that which is beautiful in our view, to hold it there.  [page 120]

> Thus, one key aspect of all labor is time. As the contemplative practice of beholding illustrates, the most fundamental aspect of what I'm calling mindful laboring is taking the right amount of time and noticing that you are doing something in a particular way, in a particular place, under particular conditions. [page 120]

Mindful labor is an experience of time.

>Barbara Adam, a Sociologist who has done copious research on the concept of time, offers a theory of timescapes that may help explain time as a component or measure of labor. In turn, her work may help teachers consider various kinds of labor data to collect, and language and activities that move students toward mindful laboring. Adam's research on timescapes (Timescapes of Modernity; Time) theorizes that time is complex and multidimensional. Her purpose for such theorizing has been to develop better ways for sociological research to be conducted, but her conception of timescapes reveals how time is not a simple construct, and we conceive and manage it in a number of ways. She offers seven ways by which time is experienced, understood, and/or framed: 
>
>- Time frame – bounded, beginning and end of day, year, life time, generation, historical/geological epoch; 
>- Temporality – process world, internal to system, ageing, growing, irreversibility, directionality; 
>- Timing – synchronisation, co-ordination, right/wrong time; 
>- Tempo – speed, pace, rate of change, velocity, intensity: how much activity in given timeframe; 
>- Duration – extent, temporal distance, horizon: no duration = instantaneity, time point/moment; 
>- Sequence – order, succession, priority: no sequence = simultaneity, at same time; 
>- Temporal modalities – past, present and future---memory, perception/ experience and anticipation. (Timescapes Challenge 7-8) [page 121]

> The time frame of clocks and calendars are stable, "externally located, [and] socially constructed," while "personal frames of life time and family time, or times of illness and stress" are more fluid, contingent, and relative.  [page 122]

> What kind of time frame is the student working from? What are the boundaries in which labor for the class is forced to adhere to? Does the student work full time and go to school? Does she have family obligations each day? Does she take other courses? Let's say she works, goes to school full time, and is a mother who must share childcare duties with a partner. This might segment her typical weekday into three or four units of time in any day with boundaries like: time that she attends class; time that she takes care of her children and family; time that she has to do school work; and time that she works at a job. These will likely not be equal segments of time, but may be how she conceives of her time in a day. Meanwhile, her week may be broken up into two or three larger segments of time: school time and work time during the weekdays; and school-work time, family time, family care time, and sleep and relaxing time on the weekends. These are the boundaries that form the time frames in which the student might consider the labor required of her for the class. [page 122]

> Where did a particular labor session fall during that week and how productive or meaningful was that labor? How might its position in their daily or weekly time frame help create that labor, make it productive, engaging, or meaningful (or not)? Are they consistent each week in where they fit the course labor in their life’s time frame? What are the consequences of its position in the day or week? Is it at the end of other taxing or strenuous labors? Is it first in any given day or week? What segments in their personal time frames are being sacrificed each week?[page 122--123]

> part of reflecting and learning from one's labor as situated in one's personal time frame is not just about reading and writing in more engaging and meaningful ways, but also about learning how one learns, managing one's time best, and understanding the boundaries and limits one has in one's life. Knowing one's labor in this way can alleviate some guilt and the sense that one is not good enough for college when one realizes that their life's personal time frame is not ideal or works against them in subtle ways, and other things are either more important at this time or can be reprioritized temporarily. Further, sharing these insights with colleagues in class can help students see that they are not alone in their struggles, that often personal time frames coalesce into patterns for reasons that are outside of the students in the room. Many students may be oppressed by larger societal structures that unfairly place boundaries and limits on their lives, making it nearly impossible to accomplish what is expected of them in college. But understanding this insight from their own labor data may offer ways to problematize their own existential situations [page 123]

Critical time management skills; this is what my students need.

> When are the good and bad times of each day or week for the labor of the class? That is, when during each day or week is the student most equipped, ready, and able to do the kinds of labor the course asks of them? Why are these times best? Could they change these timings during the semester or quarter? Does a student typically do the labor of the class during a good period, a bad one? Why? Was a particular labor session done at a good time in the day or week, one conducive to their learning or engagement? How many labor sessions in the semester or quarter fell into good time periods and how many into bad ones? Why? What kept all labor sessions from being done in only good periods? How did the timing affect the student's engagement and interest in the activity? What other activities or obligations synced up in the student's day or week that made it easier or harder to complete this labor session? Were multiple tasks or obligations coming at the student during certain periods in the labor? At what points? Why? How did the student respond? How did this syncing or timing affect what the student learned or how they engaged in the labor?  [page 123]

Unit on time; wrote: students choose an expression about time from their culture and share it and discuss its meaning and compare it to Anglo concepts of time.

> Adam says that tempo is about speed and pace, who must adapt to whose timing. How fast is an activity going? When must it begin or end? These factors make tempo a function of power arrangements (9). In other words, who or what dictates pace and speed of labor indicates who has more power in the arrangement.  [page 124]

> keep data on tempo of assignments in order to understand some of how power moves in the class, and perhaps to change it when that movement of power is not helpful to students' learning. How much time is given for an assignment of labor and who determined this?  [page 124]

> The important thing to remember when attempting to make labor more mindful in an assessment ecology, one that uses labor to determine course grades, is to honor whatever labor is offered by students, while still pushing students to ask hard questions about that labor. What happened in your labor? How did you experience it? Did you do enough? What shortcuts did you take? Could you change some things in your habits or weekly routines that would allow you to do more or labor differently? Thus, mindful laboring is practicing reading and writing self-consciously by noticing and articulating where and how our labor fits into our own personal time frames, how it and other things sync with good and bad moments in our life, and what the speed, intensity, and engagement of that labor is. [page 124]

> Mindful laboring allows for such praxis, and connects it to the grading of a course, which makes grading not a method to measure students' writing competencies or development but a process of paying attention on purpose, a process of learning about one's whole self and the structures of language and judgment that make up and affect each of us.  [page 124]

On late assignments and the future career appropriateness argument. Essentially, I don't know their future job or what their future boss is like, and likely neither do they. They'll understand the importance of timeliness in American culture, but its not my place to enforce a hypothetical boss's standards in a place of learning.
