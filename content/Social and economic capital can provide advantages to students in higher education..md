Social and economic capital can provide advantages to students in higher education[^2]. Factors such as home country education, socioeconomic status, and other currencies of cultural capital have an affect on immigrant student success in college[^1].

One form of capital that students are able to use is language. In the context of the United States, [[Success in conventional classrooms is synonymous with adopting a white racial habitus|students who are born into families fluent in the standard academic English used in universities are more equipped to meet the demands of higher education]]. Additionally, [[People who have had formal education in their first language learn a second language faster than those without.|linguistic minority students with formal education in their first language will be able to learn standard academic English faster than other linguistic minority students.]] Language ability, especially for linguistic minority students, is crucial for academic success because [[insufficient language acquisition results in poor academic performance]].

Another form involves the academic skills and cultural mores used in higher education. [[First-generation college students are half as likely to graduate on time compared to other students|Students with a family history in higher education will be more likely than their counterparts to succeed in college]]; both because [[Students who were not raised in white habitus households struggle to adopt habits of white language in college|they understand the habitus of the university]], but also because **they are more likely to receive adequate support and advice from their family**.

For students who lack these forms of capital, [[Socioacademic Relationships|socio-academic relationships between faculty and students can provide opportunities to build them.]]
