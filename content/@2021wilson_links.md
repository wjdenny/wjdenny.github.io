# Links vs Tags vs Folders in Obsidian: When Should You Use Each?

> [!summary] Summary


## Notes
Tags and links both allow multiples each note.

Links are bidirectional and make a web. They can also be transcluded. You cannot have nested notes.
Tags have no central note. Tags can be tested. 
Folders are unidirectional. A note can be only in one folder You can have nested folders. Folders group notes together, allowing for easy transfer.

Tags are useful when you don't want a hub note.
Tags are good for tracking status or type of a note.

Folders are useful for hiding information away.

Want a hub note? Use a note/link.

[[Links, tags, and folders have different uses]]
