> As faculty members and as we engage in really creating inclusive environments for our students, we really have to center at that conversation the understanding of empathy. Understanding how this is a process of learning, a process of engagement, and having both empathy for our students in this developmental process, but also empathy for ourselves. To recognize that if we have at core the desire to educate and to help students in very pivotal times of their lives to grow and become all that they want to be, then we must contribute to that in a way in which we share our disciplinary expertise, but also our humanity. 

[[Having empathy for students is the real key to reducing bias]]

> **You can't even begin to understand the different challenges that different people have been through until you actually sit down with them.** I've now sat down with enough students through these lunches that I have with them and so on to recognize the diversity of upbringings and challenges that people have faced. So now when I face a room full of 400 people, I no longer have the sort of typical stereotypes that inform, that used to inform my teaching. You know, I used to have these assumptions about who college students are and where they're coming from, and, and it was all sort of the typical stuff you get in, in any book about this generation kind of thing, right. Once you start talking to them, the richness of their lives starts to populate your consciousness. And you get in front of, in front of 450 people and they're no  longer faceless. They become sort of representative of this complexity and I really feel like one of the most  important places to start from when you're teaching is from this complexity, like just recognizing the complexity of their lives. 

> **Instructors should ==always be doing, getting anonymous feedback through students== throughout the course**. But doing anonymous surveys is not enough to build that trust with students so they'd be willing to share. So it starts really at the beginning, the relationship building, doing one-on-one meetings with students or in small groups as well. And as you create an atmosphere of trust and transparency, they are more likely to give that honest feedback, especially if you explain to them why it's so important for them to tell you and how important it is for you as an instructor to make sure that you are doing the best that you can do for the students. And a lot of times, I think just expressing that vulnerability to students that you are aware that you're not perfect and you might say and do things that might negatively impact them, that's the last thing you want. And the only way that you'll know is if they tell you, you know, and recognizing that there's a power dynamic there. So providing that opportunity for them to give you that feedback in a way that is not going to in any way diminish your perception of them.
