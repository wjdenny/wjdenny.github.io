## Inclusive Introduction
### Jessica Weiss, PhD; Professor, Director of Faculty 
Development; Department of History; California State University, East Bay [00:00:14] 
By listing off the names of resources and maybe even having some kind of scavenger hunt or fill- in-the-blank activity for students where they connect the problem, a problem with the resource, one reason to do that is you want to normalize the usage of these organizations and support groups and destigmatize the need for help, but also enable those students who don't wish to ask for help to still have that help at their fingertips because it's already there and they've already been familiarized with it.  

### Kelly A. Hogan, PhD; Associate Dean of Instructional Innovation, QEP Director; STEM Teaching Professor, Department of Biology; College of Arts & Sciences; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [00:00:51] 
It's the most basic identity factors, our names, our gender identity, we have to get those right. That is so fundamental to who we are and it's hurtful when we don't get those right. 

### Darvelle Hutchins, MBA, MA; Doctoral Candidate; Department of Communication; University of Missouri [00:01:03] 
So I think it's important when thinking about the introductions for the course to acknowledge that the introductions in the course really set the tone for the types of individuals that we're going to be interacting with. And so it was important for me to acknowledge the value of having or being able to put a face to a name. And I noticed that a lot of students enjoy that a lot more. They get to know each other a lot more. They feel that they know these individuals on a personal level and not just through a computer screen.  

### Thomas Freeman, PhD; STEM Lecturer; Department of Chemistry; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [00:01:37] 
One of the most important things for me is is not just teaching students chemistry, but, you know, they're here in college and part of my job is to actually help them develop as professional adults. They're going to go out into the work, working for somewhere, and they're really going to need to be able to do a few things really well. One of them is think critically, solve problems, and work with other people because there are, there are no jobs where you just do it all by yourself all the time. If we're really going to be able to solve some of, you know, life's more challenging problems, we really need lots of different perspectives and ideas.  

### Rudy Jean-Bart, MASS; Assistant Professor; Social Behavioral Sciences & Human Services; Broward College [00:02:16] 
We must adapt some of our teaching styles in order to fit the student makeup so that way they can really have it resonate within them and better prepare them for their careers moving forward. Because the students feel like, not only am I not getting the job that I want, but I also feel like I'm not learning because I'm not connecting to the material, then they are going to tell those who will come after them that college is a waste of time and we literally cannot afford that.

## Sharing Academic and Social Support Resources
### John Paul Horn, PhD, MSW; Assistant Professor; Department of Social Work; California State University, East Bay [00:00:09] 
So, one of the things that I like to do as a professor is to **include different types of support resources for my students**. So, I include the information in my syllabus. I also include the information verbally during our first get together. I think it's important to be proactive about sharing those resources because I think students are sometimes afraid to ask for help. And I think by getting ahead of that and including those resources in my syllabus, I'm **signaling that, not only do I care, but I also know where you can go to get the help you need**.  

### Beth, Student; California State University, East Bay [00:00:40] 
The resources that he shares signals that he is a caring, passionate person. Also, much like myself, I was one of those people that needed the resources. So, I'm very thankful for his outreach and community in his belief in a system to help us.  

## Jessica Weiss, PhD; Professor, Director of Faculty Development; Department of History; California State University, East Bay [00:00:57] 
By listing off the names of resources, and maybe even having some kind of **scavenger hunt or fill in the blank activity for students where they connect to the problem, a problem with the resource. One reason to do that is you want to normalize the usage of these organizations and support groups and destigmatize the need for help, but also enable those students who don't wish to ask for help to still have that help at their fingertips because it's already there and they've already been familiarized with it**.  

### Kelly A. Hogan, PhD; Associate Dean of Instructional Innovation, QEP Director; STEM Teaching Professor, Department of Biology; College of Arts & Sciences; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [00:01:30] 
Alright. I want to take a few minutes and remind you about the resources that are available to you on campus.  

### Kelly A. Hogan, PhD [00:01:36] 
With the number of students I teach and the amount of time I would like each student to have with a personalized instructor, it can't always be me. And so, part of my job is just marketing all of the other resources that are out there. And that's what they're there for.  

### Kelly A. Hogan, PhD [00:01:50] 
**One-on-one, you can also go to the learning center. Your student fees pay for this. You get free tutors, right? This is a really big class, and this is your chance to get some personal attention, bring any questions you have.**  

### Kelly A. Hogan, PhD [00:02:04] 
So, I find it's really helpful for students if I bring the learning specialist in. They need a face. They're often intimidated and they need to really have a face that goes with that resource.  

### Learning Specialist [00:02:15] 
The peer tutoring that Dr. Hogan talked about is Tuesday and Wednesday nights from six to nine. And it's a drop-in service, so you can meet with a tutor for a few minutes, migrate to a table, work through a few problems, and meet with the tutor again, just to make sure you've locked in your understanding.  

### Desmond Stephens, PhD; Associate Professor; Department of Mathematics; Florida A&M University [00:02:28] 
And I know sometimes it's a little scary going to these tutorial labs, so I'll be happy to go with you all as a group. I'll help you get introduced and acclimated, so you'll see that it's not a scary place. It's a place where you can get some help.  

### Desmond Stephens, PhD [00:02:39] 
**I think it's important that you take them so that they can build a comfort level and they understand that the people there to help them and not to judge them.**  

### Desmond Stephens, PhD [00:02:47] 
Because I want you to understand that there's nothing wrong with you if you think you need help, right? I keep mentioning, this is a challenging subject area.  

### Zaran, Student; Florida A&M University [00:02:56] 
Because it's a new thing and it's kind of like, you know, I don't want to go there and, you know, be nervous and be scared, and I don't want to ask any questions, like you kind of defeating the purpose of going. So, the fact that he goes with you, it'll bring your confidence level up because it's somebody that you trust going with you to help you out as well.  

### Kate Kelley, PhD; Visiting Assistant Professor; Director of Undergraduate Studies; Department of Religious Studies; University of Missouri [00:03:10] 
I always have a list of student resources around campus that are non-academic resources. And so, I include this resource list because, not only because I want to remind them of what's there for them, but I want to let them know that they're human and I get it. I get that they have a life outside of my classroom and their other classrooms. **A map of gender-neutral bathrooms on campus is really helpful. They can go to the food pantry if they are experiencing some anxiety or experiencing food scarcity.** Nobody does really well in their academics if they're worried about when they're going to eat or what they're going to eat, if they're going to eat and if they're not eating, they're not going to they're not going to be able to concentrate on, you know, on what you're giving them.  

### Tessi, Student; University of Missouri [00:03:59] 
So, she makes all of these resources, from **mental health resources** to food pantry resources, makes them clearly available to students so that they know this is something that is available if you need it. Many of us didn't know some of those things, and then some of us who needed them were able to know that they're accessible without having to go asking for it and kind of outing ourselves.  

### Tena Boehm Morgan; Adjunct Accounting Instructor; MCLCTL Division; South Mountain Community College [00:04:25] 
I decided, probably right in the beginning of online teaching, that I wanted to send my students once a week, a weekly communication. I call it the **Wednesday Read It in my required class, because I send it on Wednesdays, and in my elective class, I call it the Monday Motivator. And I think a really important feature of what I communicate with them at that point is anything that's either important to them that's been communicated to me through the school, like, is there FAFSA scholarship help sessions? Are there scholarship opportunities for them? We have a DECA club at our school and so, I let the students know about that and when the meetings are in case they want to participate in that because they're business students. I think part of going to any college or university is being part of the community**. I went to a smaller university and I always knew what was going on on the campus. I think it just makes you feel a part of the whole.  

### Adam, Student; South Mountain Community College [00:05:25] 
It gives that ability to actually meet the people from your class and, and get to know them and it really kind of helps kind of close the gap between being in a classroom and then being online as well.

## Use Inclusive Language
### Katherine McCarthy, PhD, LCSW; Assistant Professor; Indiana University School of Social Work [00:00:14] 
I try to be intentional with the language I use with students. I want them all to feel included and actively affirmed when they're in my course.  

### Beck A. Munsey, PhD, NCC, LPC-S; Department Head & Associate Professor; Department of Counseling; Tarleton State University [00:00:23] 
**Language is powerful, too, because when we use terminology that's offensive or discriminatory, it can shift the whole dynamic of a classroom.**  

### John Paul Horn, PhD, MSW; Assistant Professor; Department of Social Work; California State University, East Bay [00:00:33] 
One of the things that I do to make sure that the language in my classroom is inclusive, is that I start all of my emails with "hey folks." I try very hard to avoid gendering individuals unless I know for sure what their pronouns are. And I'm very clear about wanting to know exactly what your name is as a student and what you'd like to be called.  

### Beck A. Munsey, PhD, NCC, LPC-S [00:00:54] 
So a part of transgender and gender nonconforming students is that the use of pronouns are very important and can be either affirming or not affirming depending on the ways that you as a faculty or professor use pronouns in your course. And so the simplest thing that I notice as a transgender individual is how pronouns are used in a document that I'm reading. So the first thing that introduces me to you as a faculty member is your syllabus. **So if you have a lot of "he" and "shes" in the syllabus and my pronoun is they, then I'm going to automatically know that you're binary thinker. And so I don't know if I'm going to be seen or heard in your class just based on your syllabus.** So the simplest thing that I found that transgender and gender nonconforming students feel included in your course is if you **use the singular they when you're talking about students.**  

### Dale Ireland, MA; Lecturer, English Department; California State University, East Bay [00:01:51] 
I changed how I talk about pronouns in class. I used to invite my students to share their preferred pronouns and I moved away from that after having conversations with my friends who helped me understand how that might be a form of a microaggression just using the word "choose." And I now ask students to "share their pronouns."  

### Katherine McCarthy, PhD, LCSW [00:02:14] 
On my introductory survey with students, I asked them if they would like to share their pronouns with me, and I share my own pronouns that I go by she, her, and hers. I have that in my email. I have that on the front page of my Canvas site.  

### John Paul Horn, PhD, MSW [00:02:29] 
**I think it's important that instructors share their pronouns with students for two reasons. First, I think it's good modeling for different environments that they may go into where the pronouns of the individuals in that space may not match what the student assumes those pronouns are. But I think the other thing is that it signals to the student that this matters, that this is important, that this practice is respectful of other people in that space.** 

### Kelly A. Hogan, PhD; Associate Dean of Instructional Innovation, QEP Director; STEM Teaching Professor, Department of Biology; College of Arts & Sciences; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [00:02:57] 
**I have noticed that in the online setting we have such an opportunity that we don't have when we're face-to-face, to be able to have our names, our pronouns, anything else we want to say about ourselves in this little box, right? And so we don't want to miss that opportunity. So I'll often immediately in my courses and my interactions with students say. I've left the ability for you to change your name open in this session. You might want to put a pronoun in. And I model what I can with my name and show them that we all want to get it right. So you could go with just a first name. And then if you would normally put a pronoun with that when invited to do that, then go ahead and do that. You might want to put in parentheses the phonetic pronunciation. It's the most basic identity factors, our names, our gender identity. We have to get those right that is so fundamental to who we are. And it's hurtful when we don't get those right.**  

### Elizabeth, Student; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [00:03:57] 
The fact that Dr. Hogan Includes her pronouns in Zoom is really affirming and I absolutely love to see that. It makes it a lot more inviting and inclusive environment.

### Beck A. Munsey, PhD, NCC, LPC-S [00:04:07] 
I think as faculty to make sure that we're using the most affirming terminology in our classroom is to keep asking students. I think that's also a feedback question: Is my syllabus and written communication I send out affirming to the communities that you represent? Again, it can be anonymous type of feedback.  

### John Paul Horn, PhD, MSW [00:04:28] 
One of the ways that I keep myself accountable when I make a mistake is that I encourage students to let me know that I've made a mistake. So if I've used a name but they don't go by or have used pronoun that isn't their pronoun, I accept the feedback from my students. I say, you know what, I'm sorry, I made a mistake. Let me try that again. And then I provide a correction and I endeavor not to make that same mistake again.  

### Lena, Student; Tarleton State University [00:04:53] 
I found myself being more cognizant and aware of that after even the first week of having him as a teacher. Just the second I sign on to Zoom, putting in parentheses next to my name my pronouns. Even being more mindful that "preferred" isn't necessarily like a needed word to put before a pronoun. Asking other people what their pronouns are, just even outside of the program, just casual conversation out in the world, it just made me a little more considerate and aware.

## Preparing Students to productively Work Together
### Darvelle Hutchins, MBA, MA; Doctoral Candidate; Department of Communication; University of Missouri [00:00:14] 
So I think it's important, when thinking about the introductions for the course, to acknowledge that the introductions in the course really set the tone for the types of individuals that we're going to be interacting with. And so, it was important for me to acknowledge the value of having or being able to put a face to a name. And I noticed that a lot of students enjoy that a lot more. They get to know each other a lot more. They feel that they know these individuals on a personal level and not just through a computer screen.  

### Colwayne, Student; University of Missouri [00:00:44] 
**There are a lot of international students in the class like myself as well. So hearing where folks who are from and, you know, seeing them, that was, that was really good. And it felt, that sense of community is like you were in the classroom. So when we are on our discussion board, when, let's say, Jennifer make, makes a comment. Oh, I know Jennifer. She's from Portugal or somewhere, you know, and you're like, so you could understand where she's coming from.**  

### Darvelle Hutchins, MBA, MA [00:01:12] 
I think it creates a more inclusive environment because students feel the connection. I think that **students see the various different diverse identities that their peers come into the classroom with, whether that be a race, whether that be gender, sexuality, whatever the student decides to disclose within those videos, they get to know their peers on a very personal level. And so just being aware of the different talents and the different identities that are in the class allows for more inclusivity.**  

### Thomas Freeman, PhD; STEM Lecturer; Department of Chemistry; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [00:01:47] 
We're gonna do something called an Up, Down. I will call out a specific social group that you may or may not belong to. If you self-identify with this group, please stand up, if you feel comfortable standing up.  

### Thomas Freeman, PhD [00:01:58] 
For the Up, Down exercise, it lets students see, you know, students that they may have something in common with, as well as students that, you know, they're a little different from.  

### Thomas Freeman, PhD [00:02:08] 
Please stand up if you are from North Carolina. 

### Thomas Freeman, PhD [00:02:17] 
One of the points of the exercise overall is to help the students build a sense of community and see how they can relate to each other and work together.  

### Thomas Freeman, PhD [00:02:25] 
**Please stand up if you come from a family of four or more. Big families.** All right, wow, OK.  

### Thomas Freeman, PhD [00:02:32] 
Because in the class, I have them work together in teams, right? They work in groups. And so, you have students who come from all different backgrounds. And I want them to be comfortable with their differences rather than trying to ignore them or trying to, you know, ignore each other because they're different.  

### Da'Vianna, Student; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [00:02:48] 
I think he does the Up, Down exercise to kind of show us our commonalities and our differences. And so, when we start the conversation later on, you can understand why people might have different viewpoints.  

### Rudy Jean-Bart, MASS; Assistant Professor; Social Behavioral Sciences & Human Services; Broward College [00:03:05] 
Diversity is, is paramount in forming groups, and there's **a countless amount of studies that shows the power of diversity and how it adds, not only diversity when it comes to racial or ethnic context, but also just diversity of thought.** So, for me, to get students to be more excited about group work, I think what is, has to be foundational, is trying your very best to put them in the right group, right? And so, I don't randomly put students together in groups. I do personality tests. There's a scoring that is involved and measures things like level of openness to new experiences. And so not only do I make sure that there's diverse personality types within a group, but there's also a racial or ethnic diversity that is there in groups as well. And when I did not place students into groups years prior, I noticed that students kind of self-isolated to some of their racial groups on their own, that there's a tendency of self-segregation, even when those parameters are not being set. And so, to break through that wall, **it's very intentional that I create diverse groups.**

### Brokk Toggerson, PhD; Lecturer; College of Natural Sciences, Department of Physics; The University of Massachusetts, Amherst [00:04:13] 
All of my large courses are team-based, and I do a survey as part of that team formation process to build diverse teams because the **research shows that diverse teams are higher performing.** But you also want to make sure that you don't end up with what are known as solos. So, a common concern may be in a physics classroom is you don't want a woman in a group by herself. So, what I use the is a tool called Catme developed out of Purdue University by some electrical engineering educators, and it builds teams, collects demographic data. And I can create teams that are either heterogeneous or homogeneous in the different categories. I basically mix them up. But in the algorithm, it also makes sure that you don't end up with these so-called solos.  

### Meghan, Student; The University of Massachusetts, Amherst [00:05:06] 
Dr. Toggerson intentionally put us in groups where there were students from different backgrounds, and I think that was super beneficial because usually, you kind of link up with people are similar to you who have the same end goal. But I was actually in a group with somebody who was going to be a veterinarian and different people who had different goals than me, that I usually would not connect with even a person, in a group. So, the fact that he actually took the time to put people in groups that were different, that we usually wouldn't interact with, was super helpful.  

### Kelly A. Hogan, PhD; Associate Dean of Instructional Innovation, QEP Director; STEM Teaching Professor, Department of Biology; College of Arts & Sciences; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [00:05:50] 
I've noticed over the years that students say they hate group work, **they hate group projects, and I think a lot of it comes down to feeling like they're the one doing all the work, or this other group member isn't pulling their weight**. And there's a lot of blaming that can go on with students. And before they start forming all these opinions about each other, I want to make sure that we **perform a little empathy exercise.** 

### Kelly A. Hogan, PhD [00:06:15] 
Here's a case study I want you to take a moment to read and reflect on. A group of four students are asked to work together on a question during class in a breakout group. Three are chatting with each other, but the fourth student is quiet and not making much eye contact with the others. I want you to brainstorm three identities for the fourth student that might result in this kind of behavior that we see and then make at least one suggestion for what the other three students can do for one or all of these fourth-student identities. OK, so you're going to discuss in your breakout groups for about five minutes. And the person who has the largest pet will be the reporter for the group. 

### Student [00:06:55] 
So, we talked a little bit, like, if they have like a difference in ability, like perhaps if a student had autism or something that might make them act differently in a social setting. That could definitely be something that would affect how they interacted in a group. 

### Kelly A. Hogan, PhD [00:07:11] 
That student had a really terrible night. That student might be going through major depression, anything they can think of. And then they come from a place of empathy. But that doesn't mean they can't be included in the thinking activities that day. 

### Brad, Student; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [00:07:24] 
It helps you understand that different people have gone through different life experiences than you have and might currently be going through hard times or something that you don't understand. So, it just puts you in a mental mindset to be open and receptive to different people and what they're going through. April E. Mondy, MBA; Instructor in Management; Division of Management, Marketing, and Business Administration; 

### College of Business and Aviation; Delta State University [00:07:43] 
**I started doing team contracts in my courses for several reasons. Originally, with the group projects, it was students complaining because one person wasn't carrying their weight. Students weren't showing up to meetings. And you had all of these issues that were taking away from the actual project in and of itself. So, I decided to try to figure out a way where I can help the students out on the front end as far as the logistics and planning of the course.** 

### April E. Mondy, MBA [00:08:11] 
Hey, how are you all?  

### Students [00:08:13] 
Doing well. OK, how're you doing?  

### April E. Mondy, MBA [00:08:14] 
Great. OK, so as you know, we are getting ready to start our cultural competency project and the first phase of that is working on the group contract. And of course, **the purpose of the group contract is to kind of help you all think about how you want to function as a group. You’re gonna go over how are you going to communicate, how often you're going to meet, you're going to elect your team leader. It's making all of those decisions ahead of time. And what that does is it helps to manage expectations and it helps with your planning.** 

### April E. Mondy, MBA [00:08:46] 
So, in team projects, they have the opportunity to learn things like communication, time management, flexibility, because everyone has different schedules. **I like to tell the students, the reason why you're doing a group project is so you can learn to work with people that you can't work with. What happens when you get put in a group with someone and you have different approaches to how to solve a problem? You have different personalities, and those personalities start to clash. The classroom is an excellent opportunity for them to learn how to work through those challenges.** 

### Kathryn, Student; Delta State University [00:09:18] 
**Having team projects can benefit you for later in life. Whenever you have a real job, you're going to work with other people and be able to communicate effectively.** 

### April E. Mondy, MBA [00:09:29] 
It's also a good opportunity for them to be exposed to different perspectives, different point of views. I might have an idea for how something can be done. My classmate might have another idea. And we put those ideas together, we can come up with a better, creative, more creative solution. 

### Rudy Jean-Bart, MASS [00:09:45] 
Ideally, some of these students will become leaders, and organizations and nations can literally be stagnant when we don't have an appreciation for diversity of thought. We don't live in silos; we live in communities. And so, if you're not willing to embrace diversity of thought, then you're going to have a really tough time helping to push a community forward and we deal with the consequences of that.

## Setting Expectations and Managing for Productive Dialogue
### John Paul Horn, PhD, MSW; Assistant Professor; Department of Social Work; California State University, East Bay [00:00:14] 
One of the things that I think is important as an instructor who's bringing together a lot of different students into a community is to **establish a set of group agreement**s. So, when I start a course at the very beginning, **our very first meeting together, we sit down and we develop collaborative group agreements. The way that we do that, is that I just ask students, you know, we're developing a community, what are some expectations that we have of each other and how can we make sure that we're enforcing those expectations?** 

### Aurelia Alexander, OTD; Assistant Professor; School of Allied Health Sciences; Florida A&M University [00:00:46] 
I think it's a really good idea that, as we start the class, we make sure that we're all on the same page about what kind of conversation we're going to have so that we're all able to be respectful of each other. 

### Aurelia Alexander, OTD [00:00:57] 
I think it's important to involve the students in writing the ground rules and that we do this together so that they have the **opportunity to participate and to feel like this just isn't my rules as the instructor, but that we're in this together and these are the class rules.** 

### Jandel Crutchfield, PhD, LCSW; Assistant Professor; School of Social Work; The University of Texas at Arlington [00:01:14] 
**It allows them to think and to consider, what are we comfortable with in our group as a class? Do you want to raise your hands to talk? Do you, how do we respond when we're offended by someone? Are we going to practice listening and then respond directly to the person? Do we want to open up a discussion? Other norms in class are, we will use I statements. And so, I like that because when people express an idea, or thought, or concept is important to avoid saying things like, “Well, you're wrong.” And instead, well, “You know, I think about it this way.” But it's something after they come up with, people can actually vote on the norms. And so, OK, we wrote this down that we're going to raise their hands. How many of us agree? And creating tally marks.** Jessica Weiss, PhD; Professor, Director of Faculty Development; Department of History; California State University, 

### East Bay [00:02:06] 
Faculty members and students together can create a shared Google Document. They can then use a poll or a survey to help choose the most important planks of a community agreement. And then they can vote or consent in some fashion to that community agreement. 

### Aurelia Alexander, OTD [00:02:27] 
Jaylen, do you mind reading what we have so far?  

### Jaylen, Student; Florida A&M University [00:02:31] 
Rule number one, everyone should have a voice. Number two, listen to complete thoughts. Number three, be open minded. Number four, agree to disagree politely. 

### Jessica Weiss, PhD [00:02:43] 
**So, you want to make sure that you post that document in an accessible place. So, it should be in the learning management system and it should be something that you reacquaint students with periodically. And you mention to them that it's a living document, that it's something that they can modify as the need arises. If we haven't checked in with our classes, there, there's a chance that something's not working, but students haven't felt empowered to speak up. So, a pause, seventh week to say, I'm so glad for the ways that it really seems you guys are upholding that community agreement, so I want to affirm that and thank you. But I also wanted to give a chance in this Google Survey, for example, for you to provide some thoughts.** Let me know if we've had any missteps or slip ups and if you have any suggestions about what we might include. And then you just could come back the following week with some of those suggestions and see if the students are amenable and hopefully work their way through a conversation of those suggestions and add them if it's necessary. 

### Jandel Crutchfield, PhD, LCSW [00:03:51] 
So, in terms of equity, it's giving them that opportunity, again, to be represented, to also have their voices heard. And to, if you follow through with those norms, to continue to be able to be supported and represented throughout the rest of the entire class. 

### Kristi, Student; University of Texas at Arlington [00:04:08] 
Any time you feel like you've contributed to something, you certainly are going to, kind of hold it dear. It's not just someone handing you a piece of paper and saying, 1-10 that you must follow to say in my class. These 1-10 were things that we came up with. These 1-10 were things that meant something to us. So, it caused us to want to do the best we could to honor them.

### Rudy Jean-Bart, MASS; Assistant Professor; Social Behavioral Sciences & Human Services; Broward College [00:04:36] 
**Creating an environment where students understand that their thoughts are wanted and valued is critical, and I want it for there to be a thought in the class that we need each other because we're better together than we are apart from one another. And so, I have what I call the potluck approach. It is not me setting the dinner for everyone to eat food. It is more so recognizing that each of us has our own dish, our own variety, our own spices that we can bring to the classroom to make this an excellent meal. And of course, that meal being a learning experience.** 

### Thomas Freeman, PhD; STEM Lecturer; Department of Chemistry; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [00:05:13] 
So, take about 30 seconds to think on your own about whether or not you believe diversity in science is important. And then, you know, think about why or why you don't believe that to be the case. 

### Thomas Freeman, PhD [00:05:24] 
One of the most important things for me is, is not just teaching students chemistry, but, you know, they're here in college and part of my job is to actually help them develop as professional adults. They're going to go out into the work, working force somewhere, and they're really going to need to be able to do a few things really well. One of them is think critically, solve problems, and work with other people, because there are, there are no jobs where you just do it all by yourself all the time. If we're really going to be able to solve some of, you know, life's more challenging problems, we really need lots of different perspectives and ideas. 

### Thomas Freeman, PhD [00:05:57] 
Now that you've had a chance to have a very lively discussion about why it's important to have diversity in science, I'd like to hear some of your thoughts on this. Sam. 

### Sam, Student; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [00:06:07] 
To me, science is about trying to solve a problem. And if your solution isn't going to work because of something that you don't know because your background doesn't make you think of that, well someone else's background may say, hey, you have to consider this. And so you're actually solving the problem as opposed to just doing what you think would solve the problem. 

### Sam, Student [00:06:27] 
Instead of just being in an echo chamber where everyone is coming up with the exact two ideas, you're getting five or six or even more instead of just those two. And you have more to contemplate. And you can say, all right, well, this idea is a good one, but this one might be a little bit better, and you can evaluate more options and come up with a better solution. 

### Rudy Jean-Bart, MASS [00:06:45] 
There are certain individual experiences that the students can have that can connect to the material better than I can at times. And so therefore, it's important for me to learn the students' stories as well and not just speak from a historical context. 

### Valerie, Student; Broward College [00:07:00] 
**It's good to have engaging conversations about your perspective and about your views on things. Everyone has, everyone walks a different path in this life. Everyone sees different things. Everyone has different views. And being able to share that is, is important, is important for the classmates that aren't really around Black women to hear about Black women's struggles. It's important for me to hear about someone who comes from a family that immigrated from a different country. I want to hear about their perspectives. I want to hear about what she goes through, and I want them to hear about mine.** 

### Kristina Ruiz-Mesa, PhD; Associate Professor & Basic Course Director; Department of Communication Studies; California State University, Los Angeles [00:07:39] 
**One of the things that I value is open communication in the classroom. The challenge of open communication in the classroom is that it's open, meaning that mistakes are going to happen.** People are going to speak quickly. They're going to react. They are going to say things in the heat of a conversation that is not aligned with our community goals, with our communication goals for a classroom. 

### Aurelia Alexander, OTD [00:08:01] 
**A hot moment is something as an instructor that we do dread.**  

### Aurelia Alexander, OTD [00:08:04] 
Would anyone like to share any activity or experience that they've had that was challenging to them and that they were really going to have to use professionalism, think about cultural sensitivity . . .Jason. 

### Jason, Student; Florida A&M University [00:08:19] 
I had a therapy session with a 12-year-old girl and found out that she was pregnant and— 

### Student [00:08:27] 
Twelve? And she's pregnant?  

### Student [00:08:28] 
Yes.

### Student [00:08:29] 
Oh, I would've kicked her out of the house. That is unacceptable in my house. She would have been kicked out. 

### Student [00:08:33] 
How are you gonna say you're gonna kick her out the house. You don't know what her situation is. And what if you were 12 years old having a baby or it was your child? You're just gonna kick them out? 

### Student [00:08:38] 
She's 12, she had no business being pregnant. She should have been in school.  

### Aurelia Alexander, OTD [00:08:42] 
The thing that I want to just automatically do is just push it away and act like it didn't occur. But it's important to not do that. It's important to talk it through. 

### Jessica Weiss, PhD [00:08:52] 
**It's part of human interaction to have conflict. And so, you don't want to pretend it didn't happen. You don't want to brush it under the rug and say, oh, that's not a microaggression or this didn't just happen. But at the same time, you don't want to be reactive or angry and you want to both provide a path to redemption, as it were, without pejoritzing the person who might have committed the offense or the two students who gotten into an argument, but you also want to protect and affirm what may feel like a wound or an insult to those students who experienced or witnessed it.** 

### Aurelia Alexander, OTD [00:09:32] 
Remember, we talked about in class that we had rules and one of those rules was everyone has a voice. Everyone needs to be able to finish their thought. **And I can appreciate the passion and the engagement that you all had, but we still need to be open.** 

### Aurelia Alexander, OTD [00:09:52] 
**It is important in a hot moment situation to try to depersonalize it so that the student involved understand that it's not about them as a person, but it's more about the information and that content.** 

### Kristina Ruiz-Mesa, PhD [00:10:08] 
As educators, we have to have a mechanism in place to address problematic comments, to address hurtful comments. And so, how I do this is based out of social justice work that has been going on for the last 15 years or so in communication and in other fields. **And that's the Oops and Ouch rule. And Oops and Ouch rules are opportunities that individuals have to stop the conversation. And so, the Oops is when someone says something, a foot in the mouth moment when you realize that the words that came out just were not what you meant to say, and you can stop the conversation and redo it. The Ouch is when someone says something that's hurtful and you're like, I want you to know that you just hurt me with your words. We want to interrupt the hurtful language, interrupt the problematic statement and talk about it and say, why was that hurtful? Why did you say this? And having those open conversations allows us to get further as a community and it allows us to get back into the material.** 

### Rudy Jean-Bart, MASS [00:11:07] 
So, **I do share this quote from Paulo Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed, where he speaks about how humans are an evolving species, right? That we can constantly evolve. We don't have to stay stagnant. And it's important because there might be a moment where someone will say something in class that we may not agree with or that we may find ignorant. But to castigate that student for the entirety of the semester is not going to be beneficial to that student or us because that student can evolve and present new information that we were not aware of that might help us in our growth.** 

### John Paul Horn, PhD, MSW [00:11:45] 
One of the things **I discourage in my classroom is cancel culture. I think our classrooms are learning laboratories, and I think it's particularly important in today's society that we encourage students to know that we're not always going to say the right thing and that we are going to make mistakes. In that classroom, we can go into how that mistake happened, what they might have been thinking, and how we can avoid that mistake in the future before they ever get into the field and make that mistake.** 

### Beth, Student; California State University, East Bay [00:12:15] 
Professor Horn always, you know, tell us as students to take risks and try new things, because to be honest with you, when you get into the real world, you want to make your mistakes now during class so when you get into the real world, you don't make the same mistakes, or you know how to approach situations as they occur.  

### Aurelia Alexander, OTD [00:12:33] 
You come across a client or a patient that you don't necessarily agree with. You still need to be able to hear them out so that you can figure out how you can help them.  

### Aurelia Alexander, OTD [00:12:42] 
It provides a wonderful opportunity, a wonderful teaching opportunity to say, remember, everyone is not going to be just like you, and you can't just discharge a patient because you don't agree with them. You are going to have to figure out a way to communicate with them, because our goal is to help, 

### Kristina Ruiz-Mesa, PhD [00:13:01] 
I think, as often as we can to address things in from a place of learning to say this is an opportunity, let's invite conversation, let's invite discussion, let's invite dialogue and understand that we might not all agree and that's totally OK. And in my classroom, we're going to honor inclusive communication and we're going to honor inclusivity. And that I put on day one.

## Providing Equitable Learning Opportunities
### Rudy Jean-Bart, MASS; Assistant Professor; Social Behavioral Sciences & Human Services; Broward College [00:00:05] 
It's incumbent upon us as educators to find ways in which we can really get the students to connect to the material, and there isn't a one size fits all approach, and that needs to be understood because that is critical for the development of both the student and the educator as well. 

### John Paul Horn, PhD, MSW; Assistant Professor; Department of Social Work; California State University, East Bay [00:00:30] 
**I think it's important for instructors to design classes with the understanding that all students will need something different from the instructor. One of the ways that I learn what students need from me as an instructor, is that prior to the beginning of the semester, before we even come together for our first meeting together, I ask students, is there anything about the way you learn that I should know about? What I do worry about is students feeling compelled to out themselves as a student with a disability by asking that question. So, I certainly do encourage students to let me know as they feel comfortable. And I don't force any of my students to answer that question.** 

### Jessica Weiss, PhD; Professor, Director of Faculty Development; Department of History; California State University, East Bay [00:01:12] 
**In the Start Here section of your course shell you can place a survey of your students. And it's a survey of their learning needs or their learning conditions, depending on how you want to frame it. And you might be asking questions about conditions. For example, what are their technology tools that they have available to them? Are they attending class primarily on a phone, a tablet, via a laptop, via desktop? Is this technology shared? Are they not, do they not anticipate having access to it whenever they need it? Does the, the place where they're learning, does it have adequate Wi-Fi? You can ask these kinds of questions.** 

### Nicole Blalock, PhD; Assistant Professor, American Indian Studies Program; Core Faculty, Educational Leadership & Policy Studies Doctoral Program; California State University, Northridge [00:01:56] 
So, some of the answers that students provide might illuminate things like anxiety over being in an online class where they have to speak on camera, where everybody's focus is on them, all the way to things like they're sharing devices with other people of their household. 

### John Paul Horn, PhD, MSW [00:02:13] 
Some students need specific types of PowerPoint presentations that have images that we've put a description for. Some students are going to need PowerPoints that are less busy or PowerPoint that don't have as many animations in them because it's visually accessible for them. Some students might need access to videos where there are captions. And I think as an instructor, if we plan around all of these different things that students might need, that when a student does need it, they don't have to ask for it specifically and we don't have to deal with it after the fact. 

### Beth, Student; California State University, East Bay [00:02:52] 
In the beginning of the semester, Dr. Horn asks us, so, how do you learn? And I answer to him, I like audiobooks, because when I'm commuting, or I'm taking a long bath, or I'm cleaning my kitchen, I'm able to listen to the audio, and get all the information I need. And the fact that he has all the different resources lets me know that he really cares about our learning. 

### Jessica Weiss, PhD [00:03:16] 
You could ask these open-end questions, open-ended questions about what the students need to learn. And then you could take a next step and say, all right, let me find out from the whole class. **How do you prefer breaks to be? Do you like team quizzes or individual quizzes? And then you can kind of show students the results of the polling and then help make a decision about the syllabus and the policies with those students.** 

### Nicole Blalock, PhD [00:03:41] 
This information gets used both collectively for the course and individually for students. Individually, it does allow me to reach out to students and provide some options for them or some guidance so that they can be as successful as possible in the course. For example, if I have a student who's accessing a writing intensive course from a mobile phone, I would reach out to them preemptively and talk to them about which assignments I can offer very specific opportunities for providing voice or video recordings instead of typing out on their phone. Collectively, I look at students' overall comfort with software programs outside of our LMS and use that to adjust options for varying course materials or course assignments throughout the term. 

### Stephanie, Student; California State University, Northridge [00:04:40] 
What the survey showed me about Professor Blalock was that she's very student-centric. She really cares about her students and ensuring that no one was going to be left out. 

### Román, Student; California State University, Northridge [00:04:50] 
When she asked us these questions, it definitely made me feel listened to. It made me feel seen. 

### Jessica Weiss, PhD [00:05:04] 
It's important for faculty to take a broad view of the syllabus and look at the different assessments that they have populated their course with. If we think about **a traditional class with a high-stakes midterm and a high-stakes final, that only honors a certain set of learning skills and strengths, it honors people who are good readers, people who absorb lecture very well, and then people who don't have any test anxiety and test well. And that leaves out a number of skills. It may even leave out skills that faculty members and departments are asserting will be assessed and learned during the class.** 

### Beck A. Munsey, PhD, NCC, LPC-S; Department Head & Associate Professor; Department of Counseling; Tarleton State University [00:05:51] 
I think it's really important when we're looking at assignments and looking at, you know, making sure students are mastering concepts or skills and our programs or our courses that, what is the end goal here? And so, I want to give them an opportunity to show their mastery of content and, and also skills in the counseling profession. That's not always an APA paper. One is actually just clinical skills. Like, we I show a skill either by me modeling the skill or a video modeling the skill. And then I have them go practice the skill in class. And then we talk about that experience where they felt they did well and where they felt that they needed some work on. And then we go back and practice again. And so it’s, you know, this constant back and forth of showing mastery of a particular skill. One might be doing a presentation instead of a research paper. I also do things like art. You know, I have very creative projects. So we want to make sure that throughout the semester that we're providing opportunities for all student learners, for all students to show mastery of content in our courses besides just the traditional ways of paper and test. 

### Paige, Student; Tarleton State University [00:07:04] 
I love being very creative, so I loved that being able to do the videos and I loved being able to do the collage and being able to kind of be who I wanted to be in front of those people to kind of show them my creativity. 

### Marlene, Student; Tarleton State University [00:07:17] 
It really allowed me to show my individualism, my passion that a paper wouldn't do. 

### Rudy Jean-Bart, MASS [00:07:28] 
**Identifying and connecting them to a particular assignment type that can speak to their skill set, to their talents can definitely empower them to feel as though they belong.** One example of that is that there's a group activity or project in my class that is called the news report. Students form a news organization. They go to the past to cover an event, but they do so in a modern lens, in a modern context. So, they have to have an interview. They have to have a panel, the kinds that you often see in the modern news network, as well as use at least three social media platforms and write a blog post. And so, if you're a student and you're really adept at social media, then you embrace that version of the assignment. If you love to speak, then maybe you're going to be a panelist or you're going to be the one conducting the interview. And so, there is something for every student to do and therefore that really enhances the opportunity for students to learn the material as well as be excited about it because they're doing something that is within their wheelhouse. 

### Jason, Student; Broward College [00:08:32] 
Each different assignment plays to different people's strengths. So, some people might be better at writing, some people might be better at talking on video. Some people might want to make the videos. I like doing creative work sometimes. So, video work, especially when he let us do the news report assignment, I was in charge of making the video for my group and he said it was one of the best that he's received. 

### Rudy Jean-Bart, MASS [00:08:56] 
Offering various assignments leads to more equitable environment in the classroom because, one, it speaks to the fact that no one has a monopoly on learning, right? And so, when we're looking at what it means to deem a student successful, when it comes to grading, what we must understand is that we can assess for knowledge from a student in a variety of ways. There are some things that are sacred in the educational realm that should not be touched, right? We should always strive to create an intellectually rich environment, one that is rooted in cultivating critical thinking skills. However, we must adapt some of our teaching styles in order to fit the student makeup so that way they can really have it resonate within them and better prepare them for their careers moving forward because the students feel like not only am I not getting the job that I want, but I also feel like I'm not learning because I'm not connecting to the material. Then they're going to tell those who will come after them that college is a waste of time and we literally cannot afford that.

## Expert Insights
### Marlo Goldstein Hode, PhD; Senior Manager, Strategic Diversity Initiatives; University of Missouri - St. Louis [00:00:05] 
Inclusion is hard. Like, what's easy is doing things the way that we've always done them, and we don't have to think about it, and we can sort of like repeat the process. But when you repeat the same thing, you're going to get the same results. **So being inclusive means intentionally seeking out voices who are not currently being heard. It means intentionally asking for differences of opinion**. **So I'm thinking about, for example, instructors in the classroom. They should always be asking the question, who has a different idea about this? Who has a different experience related to this?** Because we need to have that kind of information if we're actually going to move beyond what we already know.  

### Narrator [00:00:53] 
When backpacking on a long-distance trail, novice hikers frequently employ guides to get them successfully from point A to point B, minimizing the risks of traveling unfamiliar paths. In a similar way, you serve as your students' guide and your work to use inclusive teaching practices with an intent to create equitable opportunities for learning ensures all of your students will have the learning opportunities they need to succeed. Good hiking guides get to know the hikers they're leading, what aspects of hiking are new or unfamiliar, why they signed up for the hike, and their goals. Guides use this information to provide the resources necessary to get the entire group to the summit and back safely. **In order for you to create equitable learning opportunities through inclusive teaching, it is paramount that you get to know your students, their learning needs, and the rich experiences and skills they bring to your course.** 

### Marlo Goldstein Hode, PhD [00:01:48] 
Creating a sense of belonging in your classroom has to start from day one or even before day one, actually. So if you're teaching online, for example, **you might send out a note to, an email to your students, letting them know how excited you are for the course, giving them some sense of what to expect, letting them know that it's OK to have questions and that you are there to support them**. So they come into the, either the online course or the classroom with this sense that you're on their side. 

### Narrator [00:02:20] 
Also help students get to know and trust you to guide them. Provide opportunities for them to connect with and support their community of peers through group office hours, introductory discussion forums, questionnaires, or peer interviews. After all, **research shows that when students feel valued as members of a learning community, they are more likely to persist in their educational journey and successfully complete your course.** You can demonstrate your care for students by learning their names, pronouncing them correctly, and inviting them to share their pronouns. **Additionally, share varied academic, social, and community resources to meet students' needs; food banks for those who may be experiencing food insecurity; opportunities for LGBTQ+ students to connect; scholarship or grant information; both on-campus and virtual academic and nonacademic resources, with specific guidance on how students might use any supports you view as helpful for meeting success in your course.** 

### Marlo Goldstein Hode, PhD [00:03:23] 
It's really important that instructors think about their course policies in an inclusive way. Of course, most departments or institutions have a set of required policies that you have to have on your syllabus and relate it, in relation to ADA or holidays. But thinking about the full spectrum of identities of your students, how can you make everyone feel welcome? Think about, for example, preferred names, having a policy where you have a roster where people can include their preferred names. You might also use your own preferred, or your own gender pronouns, and you don't need to necessarily require that all students share their pronouns but when you do that as an instructor, both on your syllabus, on your signature line, it signals to students that you are aware that not everybody exists on the gender binary and that you respect, you respect people's identities. It's also important to provide all the different types of resources on your syllabus that students might need access to such as, a lot of students are experiencing food scarcity. So if there's a food pantry on campus or in the community, counseling services, tutoring services, all the different services that would be beneficial to different groups of students. 

### Narrator [00:04:48] 
Also, be explicit about steps you've taken to make course materials inclusive of diverse experiences and authors, as well as accessible to meet the learning needs of students in the course. Be transparent about assessment design elements that offer students opportunities to demonstrate mastery in varied formats. And make sure your assignment expectations are clear. Provide examples and ensure students have the time and opportunity to use any feedback you provide. Also, invite student input about additional assignment needs or schedule adaptations. These messages signal that you value students and want to ensure they have every opportunity to succeed. 

### Teresa A. Nance, PhD; Vice President, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion; Chief Diversity Officer; Associate Professor; Villanova University [00:05:32] 
What does your grading mean? Is your grade a straight evaluation of the content learned? And indeed it should be. And yet I don't know anyone who doesn't have the final grade broken down into sections, right. You can have a section on the tests. You can have a section on class participation. You can have a section perhaps on an oral report. So I think in terms of equity in grading is you want to make sure that as you're coming up with that, that system or that model, that you're going to allow an equal opportunity, an equitable opportunity for students to succeed. 

### Narrator [00:06:18] 
**It's also important to invite students to form community agreements about communication and collaboration norms for working together productively with the goal of creating a productive, empathetic, and caring learning community. Students' involvement in the process, coupled with your commitment to regularly revisit agreements, affirms your expectation that they are upheld.** 

### Teresa A. Nance, PhD [00:06:42] 
When you start a class, you are really beginning a new community. And one of the things that works best is when we share understandings. And what a set of community guidelines will do, is it will try at best to put everybody's expectations in line. That I will speak from the "I" perspective. That I won't be making accusational kinds of statements. That I, that we will be a community of respect. That what's said in the room will stay in the room, right? And, and I think probably most important that we will listen, listen, listen. 

### Narrator [00:07:23] 
With community norms in place, explicitly invite and discuss the value of viewpoints that may challenge the status quo. Help students understand that innovations are often born from people who think differently and share their different life experiences. In face-to-face discussions. You might ask, "Does anyone have a different experience to share?" In online courses, you could use anonymous polling to seek student input on more controversial topics or prompt students to take an extra day to think more deeply before responding to peers in a discussion forum. 

### Sharoni Denise Little, PhD, EdD; Vice Dean/Senior Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Officer; Professor, Business Communication; University of Southern California; CEO, The Strategist Company, LLC [00:07:57] 
As faculty, we have to be thoughtful about the ways in which we encourage and affirm diverse perspectives in the classroom, whether it be in discussion, in the assignments, in the protagonists that we use, in terms of myriad resources. **And so one of the strategies that we can use is to invite students to think about which way is the most effective way for them to learn. Why is this important to you? How does this connect to your lived experiences? What do you think we should consider that we've not already thought about? Who is missing in this conversation?** And I think inviting students to contribute not only to their own learning, but to the process of learning, really reinforces for them their own value, their own intellectual contribution. And as we think about diversity and representation, especially in higher education, it also **encourages them to know that they too could be generators of knowledge and not just consumers**. And so as faculty, we also have to be vulnerable and set a stage for a classroom environment to say that I, too, am a learner, that I am modeling a growth mindset. And when we shape that type of learning, culture, and climate, students then feel more empowered to participate and to engage. 

### Narrator [00:09:31] 
Despite your best efforts to foster an inclusive environment, when students share competing perspectives, **hot moments may arise. During these times, remind students of your community agreements, acknowledge the moment, and don't hesitate to pause a class session to gather your thoughts and determine how you will respond to the entire class and/or privately to individuals when appropriate**. Your example of addressing such situations in the moment with composure and respect models how students can manage challenging conversations beyond your course in their personal lives and careers. 

### Marlo Goldstein Hode, PhD [00:10:08] 
So hot moments can come up in a lot of different ways, both in the classroom and in an online environment. And I think the first thing to know as an instructor is that it's OK to not know what to do right in the moment, number one. And probably one of the most powerful things that you can do is just take a pause. Just acknowledge and take a pause. Say, I noticed a reaction when, you know, John said, made the comment about that particular group. Or, I noticed on the discussion forum that somebody used a term that is currently inappropriate and that may not know that, so I want to take a moment to talk about why that is. So when you're doing it face to face, I think it can be challenging, but it's really important that you do do something. And so I would always start with the pause, start with the breath, and say, OK, we need to talk about this.

### Narrator [00:11:09] 
The research is clear. When students feel they belong and are supported to meet learning challenges, just like novice hikers, they are more likely to engage, achieve, and persist to reach new heights. 

### Teresa A. Nance, PhD [00:11:26] 
Don't be afraid of diversity, equity, and inclusion. That ultimately it is what sits at the center of the best education. No one comes to us to be the same. Everybody is asking to be better, to know more. And when we think about diversity, equity, and inclusion as we talk about it today, we're really thinking about how we can expand the pool of knowledge and the people who are receiving it. What could be better?
