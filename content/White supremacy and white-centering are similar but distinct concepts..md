White supremacy and white-centering are similar but distinct concepts. White supremacy is a political ideology; a system where social power moves whiteness to the center (or top of the hierarchy) and works in the context of larger social systems. White-centeredness is a phenomenon where individuals move whiteness to the center within their own thinking and behavior. When an individual has power in a given social situation, white-centeredness can fuel white supremacist culture; but white supremacist culture also influences individuals' tendency to center whiteness. It is important to remember that [[being white is not the same as having a white racial habitus.]]
