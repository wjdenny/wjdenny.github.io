## Notes
> Young writers most in need of consistent language-focused instruction may receive the least consistent support in building their writing proficiency (Menken, 2008). Developing writers need curricular continuity within and across programs and grade levels (Addison & McGee, 2010)  [page 21].

> multilingual youth in the same district may experience disruptive discontinuities in their educational trajectories when curricular programs do not bridge language development and mainstream English [page 21].

> A lack of alignment across programs denied multilingual students opportunities to learn how to write for academic purposes [page 21].

> I report findings from a yearlong ethnographic study at one California high school, analyzing the writing curriculum for conflicting conceptions of literacy within and across academic programs [page 21].

[[Inadequate transitions between language arts curricula disrupts linguistic minority students' learning progress.]]

> These gaps limit students' opportunities to learn essential academic literacy practices. For example, writing in classes for English learners may focus on vocabulary memorization over conceptual understanding (Richardson Bruna, Vann, & Perales Escudero, 2007) or controlled writing and copying from models (Hartman & Tarone, 1999; Vald√©s, 2001). Teacher support of multilingual writers can be similarly reductive, meeting assessment requirements at the expense of supporting learners' long-term writing development (Gilliland, 2014; Ruecker, 2013; Villalva, 2006) [page 21--22].
