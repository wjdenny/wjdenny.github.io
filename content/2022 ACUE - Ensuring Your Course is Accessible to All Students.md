Accessibility is something I value. It happens to be where I do a lot of my own academic scholarship and I'm also an academic with disabilities. Sometimes I have faculty friends and just even in general conversations with faculty where people are feeling very overwhelmed about creating access. And they might wonder, well, maybe I just need to wait to see who I have in the class to see whether or not I need to make things accessible. We don't know. So, even whether you know who is or is not, who might need access in your class, we live in bodies. Times are very dynamic. You don't know who you're going to have every time you come together every week. And equally important, what are we telling students when we do not create accessible work or what are we telling them in terms of who we value in society?

I offer a wide variety of resources to all my students. Closed captioning, recorded of lectures, video slides going up before class, and then with my notes after class, I re-upload them, double time on exams. I just give these things to all of my students because, one, I just think it's the right thing to do. And two, you can't manage 60 individual students who happen to have accommodations. And those are only the ones who have contacted the university. In a class of 600, there are undoubtedly many more who could benefit from such accommodations, but for whatever reason, you haven't come forward to the university. Another benefit to offering accommodations built fully within the course is then I have the mental bandwidth and the capability to deal with those students for whom the accommodations that are already built into the course are insufficient. Again, with these numbers, you name it, I've seen it. I've had students with severe visual impairment, I've had students who are going through chemotherapy. Then I can meet with that student and we can work together to find other accommodations that they need to be successful.

One thing that I've found is that material loaded, say, three to five years ago by video into the online environment probably tended to be too long. And so, one of the first things they can do is begin to think in terms of chapters and in terms of carving up what exists into smaller bites and then having those become accessible or use the chapter metaphor as a means of recreating something that's new.

Another thing you can do to make sure your class is more accessible to students who have accessibility needs is to make sure that your course material that you're going to cover that week, that those materials are accessible to those students prior to your class meeting. So, if you have PowerPoint presentations that you are going to be going over, even if they're not finalized PowerPoint presentations, even if they are just kind of the bare bones skeleton presentation, it at least gives the student something to follow along with while you're giving the lecture.

What I do universally across the board is utilize your learning management system, especially since nowadays most of your learning management systems are accessible through cell phones. I think is very valuable to have all of the information on the platform that that student who may not have access to a computer or maybe they're doing a majority of their assignments on a tablet can easily pull it up. I think it always comes back nowadays to making sure whatever you do, make it mobile friendly. 

## Kevin Kelly, EdD; Lecturer, Department of Equity; Leadership Studies & Instructional Technologies; San Francisco State University [00:04:14]
I was really grateful when one student let me know that he was living in his car. He was responding to an instruction that I had for using PDF files to submit their work. And he said, I'm taking this class called How to Learn with Your Mobile Device, and I'm only using my iPhone and I'm living in my car. How do I do the assignments that require submitting as a PDF? So, I had put a barrier in front of his learning and so I quickly removed that barrier and told all the students and email that they could use whatever they needed to complete the course requirements. 

## Brokk Toggerson, PhD [00:04:51]
For all of my assessments, I offer what is known as double time. Most instructors are probably familiar with letters and whatnot from disability services offices that indicate that certain students are entitled to double time on exams. I take that the next step and just offer it to everyone. This is the only set of physics courses they're ever going to take. I don't care if they know it fast. I just want them to know it. 

## Meghan, Student; The University of Massachusetts, Amherst [00:05:22]
So many professors stand at the front of the lecture hall and they say this is the allotted time for the exam. Disability students, this is your allotted time. So, completely making two separate groups. I have friends that are part of a disability and it is frustrating to them and is just here the normal students and here are the disability students. So, him giving everybody two and a half hours, everybody the extra time of what a disability student would get was super inclusive. I mean, I think it made everybody feel more comfortable not having to say, I'm a disability student, could I please have more time? So, I really liked, he was pretty much the only professor that I had ever seen do that, and I really liked that mentality. 

## Dale Ireland, MA [00:06:15]
If someone came to me and had never done work in creating an accessible class and getting ready to partner with the students and creating an accessible class, I would invite them to reach out to their accessibility office or disability studies office. 

## John Paul Horn, PhD, MSW [00:06:31]
They work really closely with our support team to find out whether or not the documents that I have are visually accessible for people who might use a screen reader or that the video that I'm showing is going to be accessible to individuals who might not be able to hear it, or if the person isn't able to see the video. Is there even audio description that tells them what's going on on the screen? So, I try to make sure that I'm working with the individuals who are far more knowledgeable than I am about how to make my class more accessible. 

## Jessica Weiss, PhD [00:07:04]
So, one thing you want to be able to do is know the best way to provide captioning to any videos that you're producing for your courses. And it's very likely that you're learning management system and the applications that that work with that learning management system will have a solution for that. And there are several ways to create captions that faculty can be aware of. And it's everything from YouTube which is accessible to most of us and for those campuses that have subscribed to something called Panopto. That's another possibility for providing captioning. 

## John Paul Horn, PhD, MSW [00:07:44]
Another thing that I can start with as an instructor is making sure that if I'm showing a video in class that I just click the closed caption button on that video so that any of the students I have who may not be able to hear that video, either because they have a hearing disability or because they're students who just, their speakers don't work that well, that they're able to capture the information even if they can't hear the information being presented. 

## Brokk Toggerson, PhD [00:08:11]
One of the features of PowerPoint that I think is not well known, but awesome is that there's an automatic closed captioning within PowerPoint feature. So, in the presentation you can turn it on, and the PowerPoint will listen to you speak and add closed captions to the bottom. 

## Brokk Toggerson, PhD [00:08:32]
As you are logging on, the slides for today's class are, of course, on Moodle, as always. 

## Jessica Weiss, PhD [00:08:41]
When you're in a synchronous system, a situation with your students in WebEx or Zoom or something like that, Google provides automated transcribing of in real time through their "present". It's not amazing, but it is functional. And that's something you can provide for students. 

## Brokk Toggerson, PhD [00:09:02]
There are some students who are, you know, entitled to it because of their disability services accommodations. But I got a lot of students for whom English is not their first language, and I know that having closed captions is hugely beneficial for them. 

## Jessica Weiss, PhD [00:09:17]
It's important to remember that captioning, while it may be essential for a student with a hearing disability, may still be an assist for students who are coping with noise in their home learning environment, where your words aren't coming across clearly either because of background noise or because of Wi-Fi issues. If you've captioned, they still have a chance of catching the drift of your intent. 

## Deirdre, Student; The University of Massachusetts, Amherst [00:09:47]
I did make use of the closed captions just because Dr. Toggerson talks fast sometimes, and all professors talk fast sometimes. So, it's nice to just read what they're saying while they're talking. 

## Amrita, Student; The University of Massachusetts, Amherst [00:10:01]
The closed captioning was very helpful for when I wasn't focused completely or couldn't quite understand what he was talking about. Sometimes when it came down to it, if I was learning a topic and I didn't know what he was talking about exactly, I looked up the word that was in the closed captions and he gave me all the resources I needed and that was really helpful as well. 

## Dale Ireland, MA [00:10:19]
I want to make sure that I have captions on my videos and captions aren't just where you're putting down the words. I might need to describe something that's happening when there is quiet. If there is a comment in a language other than English, I won't just put different language. I need to say what's happening. Additionally, I'll have a transcript. So, you have captions, you have a transcript with images. I will have a comprehensive description. 

## Screen Reader [00:10:50]
Image description, a person with rolled-up white shirt leaves, sitting at a wooden desk typing on a manual typewriter. 

## John Paul Horn, PhD, MSW [00:10:59]
I also make sure that any of the materials that I provide for them to read can be used using a screen reader and that all of the materials are able to be seen by people with any type of visual impairment. So, making sure that there's high contrast or that the text is without serif, those little hangey things, so that my students are better able to see the material. 

## Jessica Weiss, PhD [00:11:25]
I think just querying your students about like, how are my videos working for you? How are the slides working for you? These kinds of questions can help us realize that we've been to text heavy or created something that's too busy and not effective. If you're feeling overwhelmed as a faculty member with student needs, make sure that you check in with accessibility services, make sure you are, you know, in compliance with university policies and use that as your floor and then gradually work your way to the ceiling course by course. And it may not be perfect the first time. 

## Dale Ireland, MA [00:12:06]
In an online class, students are builders, they are building the environment and I talk about accessibility with my students in terms of them creating their work and making it accessible and reminding them they don't know how their classmates will be accessing their work and beyond their tenure, their time at the university, they don't know how other people will necessarily be accessing what they produce in terms of communication. 

## Jessica Weiss, PhD [00:12:34]
You might want to create some guidelines for students that come, you know, through your research from your Accessibility Services Office on how to produce, for example, accessible slide decks in terms of font, in terms of use of dark and light text and background, those kinds of things can be very helpful. 

## Dale Ireland, MA [00:12:50]
We spend a lot of time in class talking about accessibility and that may be in the diction, word choice and making sure that that is accessible, making images accessible, making sure that we are not producing images that can't be read by a screen reader, and then talking about the rhetorical choices that are involved. When you make work accessible, what do you include in an image description? Why do you include it? You're making rhetorical choices when you're doing that as well. And I don't want students thinking about accessibility after they've created a thing. I want them thinking about accessibility as they're building the thing. 

## Jessica Weiss, PhD [00:13:28]
Some faculty have had success in generating new material that is accessible by creating assignments that engage students in knowledge production. So, using something like Wiki Commons or Media Commons, one can send students on image searches and these can be very specific. You know, I need an image of a protozoa or I need the transcontinental railroad, an image from Utah or something like that. And then the next phase of the assignment after identification can be captioning and the alt text that goes along with this. This is an important learning experience for the students. You're not offloading a job to students, but it's a strategy that would prepare students who might end up in corporate communications to begin to learn the process of, first of all, rights of usage on the Internet. And second of all, creating accessible materials in their professional life. 

## Dale Ireland, MA [00:14:39]
It's important that students feel confident in creating accessible content, that they understand the choices they make when they create an accessible word document, when they create captions and transcripts for a movie, when they create a transcript for a podcast. It's important that students understand why they might use timestamps and how that might be valuable to someone who needs to access the work in small bits and needs to be able to keep track. I want students to understand that there are many different ways people might be accessing their work. And so, everything that students are creating in class, especially when they're accessing one another's work, it must be accessible. 

## Daniel, Student; California State University, East Bay [00:15:23]
I feel like it's a way of the teacher including the students and helping each other. You know, if we didn't do it, she would have to do it for every document that we upload. And we can all help make everyone feel like equal and everyone has a chance to succeed in the class. 

## Dale Ireland, MA [00:15:42]
When we create accessibility, we oftentimes open up things for a lot of people. If you think about the curb cut example, whereas it might work for someone like me with a wheelchair or a walker, it might work really well for my sister with a carriage or a stroller that she's using as well. 

## Brokk Toggerson, PhD [00:15:59]
By building all of these various accessibility structures into the course itself, it means that any student, regardless of whether they have official accommodations or not, has the resources that they need in order to be successful in my class.
