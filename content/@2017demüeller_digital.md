## Notes
> Undocumented migrant students, called Dreamers based on the DREAM Act, often have institutional roadblocks in their transition form high school to college due to their immigration status. In August, 2012, the Migration Policy Institute (MPI) reported that, "according to MPI's analysis of Current Population Survey (CPS) data from the U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, as many as 1.76 million unauthorized immigrants under the age of 31 who were brought to the United States as children are, or could become, potential beneficiaries of the deferred action initiative." Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) is an executive order proposed and signed by President Barack Obama in 2012 that allowed for "prosecutorial discretion." With increased migration, "the logic of Obama's policy of 'prosecutorial discretion' is to allow immigration enforcement officials to focus their resources on those who have committed crimes, rather than deporting young people who actively participate in society and were brought as children to the USA by their parents" (Schmid, 2013, p. 697). DACA offers temporary protection from deportation and allows the individual to work and or attend college. If passed federally, the Development Relief and Education of Alien Minors Act (DREAM Act), another important piece of legislation, would offer undocumented persons a pathway to citizenship via either a  college degree or military service. [page 130]

> Specifically through their online presence, Dreamers have formed alternative digital literacy initiatives by using their genres to support a sustainable activist network. [page 130]

> This migrant rhetorical and writing agency has become the new norm and is generating novel linguistic ecologies in academia and particularly in the writing classroom. When using "an ecological approach to language in society [it] requires an exploration of the relationship of languages to each other and to the society in which these languages exist" (Creese & Martin, 2003, p. 1). [page 131]

> An ecological approach addresses the sociopolitical environment in which the language is generated. Through genres and writing strategies appropriated from dominant discourses in a transnational, transcultural, and translinguistic space, Dreamers respond to how the DREAM Act text and public discourse in immigration in the United States situates immigrants rhetorically, changing the public immigration debate and the university. [page 131]

> **Latino students, both U.S. citizens and undocumented, confirmed that "==framing educational pursuits as ways students can fight discrimination, enhance ethnic pride and assist their communities when they return with college degrees can make college more attractive==" (*Camino*, 2007, p. 3).** [page 131]

The author advocates students using education as ways to fight discrimination and enhance ethnic pride (p. 131). How can faculty assist this development? With recent moves towards critical race theory and DEI initiatives, what levels of institutional power might allow faculty the freedom to continue this line of work?

> It is estimated that "approximately 65,000 undocumented students graduate from high school each year" (Schmid, 2013, p. 697). Migrant students often cross over as infants or very young children and "because of barriers to their continued education past high school, including poverty (almost 40% of undocumented families live in poverty) they are excluded from legal employment and often discouraged from attending college (Immigration Policy Center, 2011)" (Schmid, 2013, p. 697). [page 131]

> Two weeks before September 11, on August 21, 2001, the Student Adjustment Act, now called the Development Relief and Education of Alien Minors (DREAM) Act, was presented in the U.S. House of Representatives by Rep. Howard Berman (D-CA) and Rep. Chris Cannon (R-UT). From 2001--2010 the DREAM Act went through several revisions and redrafts. In September of 2010, the DREAM Act, along with the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell (DADT), was included in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011. Senate Republicans effectively filibustered the passage of the bill. In December 2010, the House passed the bill, but again it did not advance to the Senate. In May 2011, Sen. Harry Reid reintroduced the DREAM Act in its current incarnation. The DREAM Act has faced several legislative barriers to its passage. In response to these problems, President Obama issued DACA in 2012. [page 132]

> According to Schmid (2013), to qualify for DACA, an undocumented person must meet the following requirements:
> 
> - came to the USA under the age of 16;
> - has continuously resided in the USA for at least five years prior to June 15, 2012;
> - has graduated from high school, has obtained a general education development (GED) certificate, or is an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or Armed Forces of the USA;
> - has not been convicted of a felony offense, a significant misdemeanor offense, or multiple misdemeanor offenses, or does not otherwise post a throat to national security or public safety; and
> - it not above the age of thirty.
> 
>  [page 132]

> Since "attempts to expand rights, even for individuals who were brought young to the USA and have attended American schools have been blocked at the federal level," DACA provides a pragmatic way for persons who are by all response acting as citizens in the United States to participate in society. However, the problem remains that even though "DACA offers short-term amnesty and temporary relief from deportation ... undocumented individuals have no clear path to resident alien status (possession of a green card) or citizenship" (Schmid, 2013, p. 701). [page 132]

> Besides legal issues, for many undocumented students difficulties arise rhetorically, discursively, and educationally. Because "there is no universal right to pay in-state tuition at institutions of public colleges and universities or even attend higher education for undocumented students," they are situated as not worthy of education and are always in contentious scenarios when trying to enter academia (Schmid, 2013, p. 697). To combat this concern, some states have policies that allow undocumented students to pay in-state tuition. In two of these states,
> 
> > Texas and New Mexico, undocumented students are also eligible for state financial assistance. Studies show that offering in-state tuition makes a considerable difference instates with such provisions, one and a half times more non-citizen Latinos enroll in college than do similar students in states without such provisions.

> With Dreamers' websites and online resources as my primary texts, I conduct a critical discourse analysis, informed by social language theory, focusing on how Dreamers respond to the rhetoric surrounding the immigration debate. Specifically, I use a framework employed by Eleanor Lamb (2013) in her analysis of UK immigration policy from 1968--2009. She asks "how far [UK] immigrant organisations were able to challenge marginalising representations of migrants and refugees" (p. 339). First, Lamb lays out a three-tier system of analysis:
> 
> - Investigate the sociopolitical context of each time period
> - Map the different kinds of organizations and the genres that one case-study organization was able to access in each time period
> - Text-level analysis
> 
>  [page 133]

> What is lacking in this analysis is how immigrant activists and organizations combated the ways the UK legislation constructed racial and ethnic identities. [page 134]

> the National Council of La Raza (NCLR) Blog, Immigration Equality, and the Immigrant Youth Justice League. [page 134]

> The National Council of La Raza Blog was created as a way to highlight the ongoing narratives of immigrants navigating U.S. immigration policy. It mainly focuses on students trying to apply for DACA or already in the DACA program. Immigration Equality is an activist website centered on strategizing ways to effect legislation. Its focus is providing resources for an activist network of youth-led organizing and protesting anti-immigration lobbyists. Finally, the Immigrant Youth Justice League provides a list of scholarships for undocumented students categorized by national, state, and city funding initiatives. This website is focused on providing financial resources to students and helping migrant students to navigate the university financial realm. [page 134]

> I have outlined three genres commonly used by DREAM Act activist websites: narratives, calls, and guides (Stein & Giltrow, 2009, p. 1) and aligned them with Halliday's (2006 )three functions of language-- the ideational, the interpersonal, and the textual (pp. 57--59). [page 135]

> The series "Hanging in the Balance" on the NCLR Blog details narratives of undocumented persons dealing with DACA. In the post titled "The Tale of Two Latinas," the stories of Carla Mena and Karla Salgado are reported.
> 
> > Despite their tenuous status in their adopted country, the young women's commitment to their community remains strong. In recent months, Karla was appointed by Raleigh's mayor as the youngest member of the Downtown Plan Advisory Committee. Carla is also giving back to her community and was recently selected to serve on the Board of Trustees of the Wake Health Services. Both girls also volunteer on the Youth Council at El Pueblo, Inc. an NCLR Affiliate ... the two women have made a positive impact in their communities.

Basically a PR campaign for a group of people-- we need this for queer and trans folks!

> The narrative shows a sense of civic responsibility, an important aspect of citizenship. As Schmid outlined, the third aspect of citizenship includes the social "identity or behavior aspects of individuals and conceiving as members of the collectivity, classically the nation." The DREAM Act text functions as a way to exclude the undocumented migrant and conceptualizing the migrant as "alien" and "criminal" and without "good moral character." The Dreamer narrative works against that rhetoric and composes the migrant as a social citizen, along Schmid's definition, and a person who adds to the collective nation. [page 136]

> The narrative is both ideational and interpersonal, invoking the personal, private experiences of the Dreamers (tenuous status, adopted country, positive impact, commitment to community) while entering the very problematic and ongoing discussion in the public relam (U.S. Congress has failed, urge President Obama to provide relief). These narratives aid in teh discursive and rhetorical transfer of students into the university. They give a way to use private rhetoric and discursive strategies to shift the public rhetoric on immigration issues. By focusing and shifting the discussion to include "our community" and a failed U.S. immigration structure, it makes the private public and the transfer to the academy evident and a natural progression. [page 136]

I don't understand what that story had to do with going to college, though.

> On the Immigration Equality website, they have a call to get the vote out and determine which U.S. Congress members are pro-immigration rights. This process is separated into three steps:
> 
> - Research a U.S. congressional voting record
> - Determine who best to vote for
> - Share the info with other voters

> **==Guides== are especially problematic in that they may in a sense ==be tools for assimilation==. At once they ==show explicitly the resources and tools of a white dominant structure in the university== and also in many ways ==ask the undocumented to adhere to these structures==. **[page 138]

Am I asking my students to assimilate? Don't I need to, to some extend?

> What these guides ignore is the institutional racism undocumented students will experience on campus as they try to work toward graduation. In some ways, the guides give students agency and the explicit steps to work toward entrance into the university and attainment of the baccalaureate. In other ways, the guides ask students to assimilate to a primarily white dominant structure. [page 138]

> As migrant undocumented students enter the university at increasing rates, instructors should begin to discuss how best to serve an ethnolinguistically diverse population, and
> 
> > as writing practitioners and scholars increasingly acknowledge the rapidly accelerating dissemination of linguistic heterogeneity across the nation and worldwide, more questions arise about the most responsible and adequate way to respond to language difference in the teaching and assessment practices.

> > (*Ayash, 2014, p. 116*)
> 
> A part of this inquiry should include acknowledging the linguistic practices students bring to them into the classroom and finding ways to embed those practices in instruction. [page 139]

> Migrants are adept at appropriating genres while avoiding assimilation. [page 139]

> **Transcultural repositioning is "a notion grounded in the idea that members of historically excluded groups are in a position to cultivate adaptive strategies that help them move across cultural boundaries by negotiating new and different contexts and communicative conventions" (Guerra, 2008, p. 299). In this view of transition, the dominant structure is not privileged but rather it's placed as a position the student may move across for specific rhetorical purposes.** [page 139]

I think this is similar to the direction I'm headed with HSC-160 and other courses. I want them to make the choice of how and when to use different language or cultural strategies with the understanding of what those strategies mean to different people in different contexts.

> A critical undocumented migrant pedagogy would include a central focus on transculturalism and translingualism, a multifaceted approach to migrant student discourses focused on transference by use of migrant genres, and an acceptance of the re-localization of linguistic skills in migrant student writing when they "mobiliz[e] linguistic resources" (Sohan, 2014, p. 203). Sohan (2014) suggests this mobilization of language skills is a way for students to choose their strongest linguistic skills and utilize them as a means of meaning making. This often manifests in what writing instructors see as error. To respond to this re-localized writing, **instructors should consider employing what Sohan terms as re-localized listening, which "asks teachers to ==think of reading, writing, and revision== differently-- ==as alinear dynamic, interconnected processes that attend to the movement of meanings within and beyond texts and contexts==" (Sohan, 2014, p. 193).** Using this method would align with a critical pedagogy approach that is mindful of the experiences of migrant student writers. As Sohan (2014) has noted, working with student writers in these ways can help them:
> 
> > to understand the ways individual readers and writers re-localize their reading and writing practices emphasizes the agency of readers/writers as the producers/transformers of the language conventions they repeat in the process of listening: re-localized listening treats language not as preformed but as actively shaped and reshaped in both form and meaning every time a writer re-localizes it (employs it in contexts for which it has not be traditionally used).

> The migrant activist student uses language for powerful political ends, enters the academy, and changes it. The migrant activist student sees the "self as situated within a discipline and within the world, confronting racism head on as well as other situations that distance women, the poor, and others from the dominant discourse and its racialized and gendered assumptions" (Villanueva, 1999, p. 172).
