## Notes
> What started me on it was my interest in the trend in American schools and colleges called "writing across the curriculum," whereby writing is no longer the sole possession of the English teacher but is an organic part of how every subject is taught. [p. vii]

[[The idea of writing across the curriculum spread the responsibility of writing instruction across all departments, instead of just the English department]]

> The writing of the book proved one of its central points: that we write to find out what we want to say. [p. viii]

> He said that in the fall term Gustavus Adolphus [College] would launch a curriculum in which 75 courses, covering the entire spectrum of a baccalaureate education, would be listed with a "W," meaning that writing would be a required part of the course, that it would be a factor in the student's grade and that the teachers would work with the students on the process of organizing, writing and rewriting their papers and reports. Three "W" courses would be required for graduation.

> The teaching of writing should no longer be left just to English teachers but should be made an organic part of every subject. The idea, which goes by the name of "write across the curriculum," has been very in the air among Educators for at least a decade. [p. 12]

[[The concept of writing across the curriculum has been a topic since at least the 1970s]]

> Students often feel guilty about modeling their writing on someone else's writing. They think it's unethical--which is commendable. Or they're afraid they'll lose their own identity. The point, however, is that we eventually move beyond our models; we take what we need and then we shed those skins and become who we are supposed to become. But nobody will write well unless he gets into his ear and into his metabolism a sense of how the language works and what it can be made to do. That's a fundamental premise of this book. [p. 15]

[[Writing, like all arts, must first be learned from imitating appropriate models]]

> Curiously, hasn't been the prevailing theory in our schools. American children have long been taught to visualize a composition as a finished edifice, his topic sentences All In place, it's spelling correct, it's appearance tidy. Only lately has there been an important shift. The shift--in the terminology of the trade-- is from "product" to "process." It puts the emphasis where it should have been all along: on the successive rewritings and rethinkings that mold an act of writing into the best possible form. If the process is sound, the product will take care of itself [p. 16].

> "What we found developing at Gustavus Adolphus [College] was a sense that we should all be sharing the responsibility for teaching writing. [...] One reason for the high response is that everything is voluntary. If the program had been imposed by the administration I don't think it would work." [p. 17--18]

[[Effective organizational change often comes from the ground up rather than imposed from the top down]]

> Probably every subject is interesting if an avenue into it can be found that has humanity and that an ordinary person can follow. Writing was such an avenue--perhaps, in fact, the main route [p. 19].
