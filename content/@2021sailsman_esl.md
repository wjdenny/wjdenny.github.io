## Literature notes
[[Faculty have the responsibility of understanding the culture of their students]]
[[Insufficient language acquisition results in poor academic performance]]
[[Integration must be a priority for the academic success of all students]]
[[Linguistic minority students can feel isolated within the institution]]
[[The pace for cultural integration is individual]]
[[The specific goals of cultural integration are individual]]

## Source notes
> Integration in the area of higher education not only encompasses cultural norms but also language and communication. Integration allows individuals to coexist simultaneously with their own culture while engaging consistently with their new culture (Boafo-Arthur, 2013). Exploration of the integration experience is crucial to understand how students, for whom English is a second language (ESL students), fair in higher education environments. [page 152]

The ideal would be for all parties (including those who've adopted the dominant white habitus) to need to integrate; creating a neutral cultural ground that de-centers whiteness and levels the playing field for everyone.

However, this article seems to center whiteness by focusing on how ESL students can be brought into the dominant culture.

> Having an appreciation of a student's level of acculturation by way of integration could assist nursing educators to identify those ESL students who may have increased risk of poor academic performance and provide them with the support necessary for success ([[@2018choi_effectiveness|Choi, 2018]]; [[@2019onovo_fundamentals|Onovo, 2019]]; [[@2008salamonson&everett&koch&andrew&davidson_acculturation|Salamonson et al., 2008]]). [page 152]

> Although students may pass this [TOEFL and other English] examination and gain admittance into nursing programs, many struggle with English language acquisition, and integration ([[@2008salamonson&everett&koch&andrew&davidson_acculturation|Salamonson et al., 2008]]). This struggle leads to poor student outcomes and ultimately, attrition from the program ([[@2013crawford&candlin_language-needs|Crawford & Candin, 2013a]]; [[@2013san-miguel&townsend&waters_redesigning|San Miguel et al. 2013]], [[@2011scheele&pruitt&johnson&xu_asian|Scheele et al., 2011]]).

> Evidence located led to the grouping of students focused on language and cultural integration, cultural stress and isolation, academic language learning, faculty support, faculty competence, faculty bias, and instructional strategies. [page 152]

> To prevent attrition and promote retention, [[@2011fergy&marks-maran&ooms&shapcott&burke_promoting|Fergy et al. (2011)]] recommended that social and academic integration become a key imperative in the university setting.

> the challenge of integration, both from a language and social perspective, can be very stressful ([[@2013crawford&candlin_language-needs|Crawford & Candlin, 2013a]], [[@2013crawford&candlin_investigating|2013b]]; [[@2011jeong&hickey&levett-jones&pitt&hoffman&norton&ohr_understanding|Jeong et al. 2011]]; [[@2012malecha&tart&junious_foreign|Malecha et al., 2012]]; [[@2013san-miguel&townsend&waters_redesigning|San Miguel et al., 2013]]; [[@2009starr_nursing|Starr, 2009]]; [[@2011suliman&tadros_nursing|Suliman & Tadros, 2011]]). Language is possibility one of the most important dimensions of integration, especially when exploring its relationship to the academic performance of students in higher education ([[@2008salamonson&everett&koch&andrew&davidson_acculturation|Salamonson et al., 2008]]).

> ESL students enter the classroom with knowledge and experience built into their first language and culture; these often are subtle but can influence learning ([[@2014alhasiany_english|Alhasiany, 2014]]; [[@2015donnell_correlational|Donnell, 2015]]; [[@2011jeong&hickey&levett-jones&pitt&hoffman&norton&ohr_understanding|Jeong et al., 2011]]; [[@2013san-miguel&townsend&waters_redesigning|San Miguel et al., 2013]]).

> [[@2012olson_english|Olson (2012)]] shared insight into cultural barriers and bridges to success. Barriers included differences in the way American students communicate with faculty, with little regard for the authoritative role, issues of racism, and differences in providing therapeutic communication to patients.  [page 153]

> [[@2012he&lopez&leigh_perceived|He et al. (2012)]] investigated cultural stress and sense of coherence (willingness to use adaptive coping resources) for Chinese nursing students who were studying in Australia.  They determined that acculturation stress varied significantly, depending on a student's year in the academic program. First-year students did not have the same concerns or worries as second- and third-year students. Sense of coherence was negatively correlated with the students' level of stress. [page 153]

> In a qualitative literature review regarding the challenges faced in nursing education for students who identify as ESL, [[@2009starr_nursing|Starr (2009)]] found that, in academics, culture transitions caused stress, less-than-acceptable grades, and emotional turmoil and that these issues led to low self-image and shame, resulting in difficulty engaging with coursework.

> [[@2008wang_learning|Wang et al. (2008)]] engaged in semistructured interviews with 21 Taiwanese nursing students studying in Australia; they found that isolation was an issue for some participants. They reported that the Taiwanese students reported maladjustment and feeling like a stranger.  [page 153]

> [[@2002sanner_experiences|Sanner et al. (2002)]] found social isolation to be a major theme. Students restorted to verbally retreating/silencing because of their feelings of nonacceptance from their non-ESL peers.  [page 153]

> Boafo-Arthur (2013) identified multiple studies in which black Africans enrolled in higher education reported issues of prejudice and discrimination, leading to experiences of stress. These students, like others in similar studies, reported feelings of alienation, apprehension, anxiety, dread, rejection, and confusion (Chavez, 2014; Crawford & Candin, 2013a; Du & Wei, 2015; James, 2018; He et al., 2012; Lee & Padilla, 2014; Malecha et al., 2012; San Miguel et al., 2013; Suliman & Tadros, 2011; Talley & Hui-ling, 2014; Tas, 2013; Zhang & Kenny, 2010).  [page 153]

> In a qualitative study of first-year ESL nursing students, Weaver and Jackson (2011) identified two major areas related to academic writing: issues understanding course information and problems expressing that content in English. Similar studies highlighted student challenges understanding assignments, especially those containing nursing and medical language (Clerehan et al., 2011; Crawford & Candlin, 2013a, 2013b; Fuller, 2013; Greenberg, 2013; Jeong et al., 2011; Johnston et al., 2013; Koch et al., 2011; Lum et al., 2015; Onovo, 2019; Rogan & San Miguel, 2013; Suliman & Tadros, 2011; Weaver & Jackson, 2011). Language being a barrier to achievement was one of four themes that emerged from a qualitative study of ESL nursing students studying in Australia (Koch et al., 2011). Participants noted that having the ability to focus on pronunciation through spoken word exercises increased their capacity for interaction (Alhasiany, 2014; Koch et al., 2011; Rogan & San Miguel, 2013). [page 153]

What were the other three themes?
What does this mean?

> Second- and third-year nursing students reported that ongoing exposure to the English language was most effective in helping develop listening and speaking skills (Crawford & Candlin, 2013b). Participants reported challenges with listening comprehension during conversations with patients and colleagues, along with awareness of their own accents and grammar (Crawford & Candlin, 2013b). [page 153]

Self-reported, though.

[[Linguistic input drives language acquisition.]]
[[Anxiety is a major obstacle to learning a foreign language]]

> Jeong et al. (2011) reported participants had feelings of frustration, panic, rejection, and embarrassment secondary to their inability to understand the language in lecture and clinical settings. [page 153]

> Nursing students who come from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds are more inclined to be engaged and participate in coursework when they feel welcomed and safe in the learning environment (Fuller, 2013). Mutual respect between students and educators with cultural differences enhances learning (Fuller, 2013; Onovo, 2019; Scheele et al., 2011). One of the hindrances faculty members have in cultivating a nurturing and culturally inclusive environment for ESL students may be secondary to their own personal deficits in knowing how to engage with this population of students (Bosher & Bowles, 2008; Brown, 2008; Crawford & Candlin, 2013a; Debrew et al., 2014; Denham et al., 2018; Hansen & Beaver, 2012; Koch et al., 2011; Olson, 2012; Salamonson et al., 2008; Scheele et al., 2011; Speece, 2012; Starr, 2009; Suliman & Tadros, 2011; Tan, 2009; Wang et al., 2008). Wang et al. (2008) suggested that universities and their faculties may not fully understand the needs of ESL nursing students and are consequently inadequately prepared to provide them with a quality personalized educational experience. [page 153--154]

Is it possible to require Stand Above the Crowd as a lab component of HSC-160?

> Nurse faculty need to become more culturally competent and foster a learning environment that is sensitive to diversity and inclusion (Denham et al., 2018; Du & Wei, 2015; Fuller, 2013; Greenberg, 2013; Hansen & Beaver, 2012; Jeong et al., 2011; Malecha et al., 2012; Mareno & Hart, 2014; McDermott-Levy, 2011; Onovo, 2019; Scheele et al., 2011). Campbell (2008) shared that faculty should not only be cognizant of various learning styles of students but also be empathetic to the reluctance of some students to question authority because of cultural norms. [page 154]

A student should still be able to be successful if they're shy. 

> in Australia, Wang et al. (2008) found faculty lacked cultural sensitivity and had an inability to engage with ESL nursing students. Denham et al. (2018) shared that faculty should be mindful not to shame or embarrass ESL students because of their lack of understanding. The authors also noted that faculty should be aware that classroom interactions, along with students' comfort in communicating, are predictors of academic success. [page 154]

What are their cultural needs?

> Brown (2008) shared that approaches to learning, to health care, and to the relationship between a student and instructor vary among cultures. As ESL nursing students navigate the demanding and often stressful curriculum, support from culturally competent faculty is essential for success and a positive outcome (Hansen & Beaver, 2012; Onovo, 2019; Suliman & Tadros, 2011). Students feel their cultural needs are underappreciated, and lack of faculty support is a barrier to their success (Olson, 2012; Starr, 2009). Another barrier is the feeling of some students that they are being asked to discard their cultural practices to fit in with the dominant culture (Debrew et al., 2014). Students often do not find the encouragement and support they need and expect (Choi, 2005; Hansen & Beaver, 2012; Onovo, 2019; Sanner & Wilson, 2008; Sanner et al., 2002; Suliman & Tadros, 2011). Wang et al. (2008) found personal counseling and academic support were regarded as highly important to ESL nursing students. [page 154]

> self-report, Greenberg (2013) found that faculty members who participated in a development program improved their cultural competence in mentoring ESL nursing students. Debrew et al. (2014) cautioned that short-term fixes, such as an occasional cultural competency program for nurse educators, do not address the need for improvement on a larger scale. It is essential for nurse educators to acknowledge the Eurocentric culture of nursing education and hire diverse aculty. In addition, educators should be aware and mindful of the visual imagery presented in course material, ensuring it is representative of the students being taught (Debrew et al., 2014). Programs that provide cultural sensitivity training for faculty would help to strengthen nursing programs and improve retention (Dudas, 2018). [page 154]

Implications for redesigning HSC-160? 
- connecting students to resources
- support for cultural conflict
- could give credit for attending SATC?

> Choi (2005) provided insight into how nursing faculty members should develop instructional strategies and engage with their students. Faculty should be mindful of confusing terms and concepts included in test questions and assessments that necessitate cultural intepretations [sic] of meanings (Denham et al., 2018; Dudas, 2018). Terms such as tossed, cocktail, and something as seemingly common as Cheerios can be misinterpreted and lead to poor test outcomes for students (Coddington & Karsten, 2014). [page 154]

> The development of innovative teaching strategies that support the cultural needs of ESL students and embrace their unique diversity is the beginning step toward faculty cultural awareness (Denham et al., 2018; Hansen & Beaver, 2012; Koch et al., 2011; Suliman & Tadros, 2011). The implementation of active engagement with ESL nursing students through specific support systems, like mentoring, will help foster positive outcomes (Wang et al., 2008). Choi (2018) explored the effectiveness of an ESL nursing student support program and found that addressing psychosocial and academic needs fosters student success. [page 154]

> culturally competent and theoretically informed instructional strategies are appreciated and valued by this population of students. [page 154]

> In a study to identify language needs of culturally and linguistically diverse students and evaluate an English language support program, Crawford and Candlin (2013b) reported themes that focused on the need for faculty support in the area of instructional strategies. Students suggested lecturers speak more slowly, paraphrase dialogue from other students, provide lecture notes prior to class, reduce the use of colloquialism and idioms, and engage on a personal level. These suggestions mirror the literature regarding the need for a focus on the broader learning environment and the radical rethinking of how students from diverse populations are educated (Fuller, 2013; Ooms et al., 2013). [page 154]

> Sanner and Wilson (2008) found that language was not the primary reason for program difficulty; rather, the discrimination and stereotyping students experienced led to failure. Students reported feeling the need to prove themselves in the classroom and in personal relationships. There was a great divide between participants' learning style of rote memorization and faculty teaching style of self-directedness. Self-concept was negatively affected as participants tried to live up to faculty expectations and conform to their American peers (Sanner & Wilson, 2008). James (2018) shared a similar finding in a one-subject narrative inquiry; the student received negative comments from a faculty member, eliciting feelings of being unintelligent and unworthy. Power distance index is a common cultural dimension found in the learning environment when the instructor is seen as the one holding a position that is superior to the learner's position (Hofstede, 1986). Denham et al. (2018) cautioned faculty to guard against judging ESL students as weak secondary to lack of engagement or poor grammar. [page 154--155]

> Strong attitudes within nursing and the subculture of nursing education make it difficult for nurse educators to work effectively with cohorts of diverse students (Bednarz et al., 2010). One particular attitude stance is to treat everyone the same, regardless of race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status --- a poor approach that creates significant obstacles to recognizing the realities among diverse nursing students and places barriers to student success (Bednarz et al., 2010). Malecha et al. (2012) reported four common themes interdependent among foreign-born students attending nursing school in the United States: a) language and communication issues; b) peer and faculty discrimination; c) prejudice; and d) lack of support, loneliness, isolation, alienation, and cultural issues. In a focus group to discuss foreign-born nursing students' stress and perceived faculty support, students reported that, although cultural awareness was addressed in the curriculum, faculty were incompetent in terms of understanding their values and traditions. Nurse faculty actions were not sensitive to students' cultural needs (Junious et al., 2010). It is important to reevaluate approaches to nursing education to remove the cloak of cultural imperialism in which otherness is ostracized and marginalized (Clary Muronda, 2016; Dong & Temple, 2011) [page 155]

> Faculty and those in higher education leadership play an important role in this process and should be highly engaged in the removal of barriers and the building of bridges. [page 155]

> These barriers can be reduced by purposeful preparation of students for this style and level of learning. This preparation includes early assessment of learning needs and addressing those students who are at risk for attrition. [page 155]

... and recognize that not all student's needs are the same.

[[Not all linguistic minority students are the same]]

Can rote memorization be an effective learning strategy? In defense of ...
We do seem to have an irrational distaste for it when it should at least have its place even if it isn't more effective than other methods.

> Fostering self-awareness and a sense of belonging among their peers and faculty is a common journey among ESL nursing students. Support from faculty along this journey is imperative for student success. [page 155]

> The observation and acceptance that cultural barriers, including language, peer interaction, and lack of faculty support/competence, exist for ESL nursing students is a starting point for further inquiry. [page 155]
