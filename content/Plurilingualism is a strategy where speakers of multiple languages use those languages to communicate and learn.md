Plurilingualism is a strategy where speakers of multiple languages use those languages to communicate and learn. [[Students come to the classroom with a range of communicative and technological abilities and educational experiences]] [[Plurilinguals have tremendous flexibility in their language usage which allows them to mediate effectively across diverse audiences]] 

All of a person's linguistic ability is combined into a single linguistic repertoire. [[Language repertoires are not collections of discrete language competencies, but they are combined into a single plurilingual repertoire]] [[Plurilingualism accepts that everyone uses a variety of language or dialectal resources for different purposes]]
