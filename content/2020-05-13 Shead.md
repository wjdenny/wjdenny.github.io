# Elon Musk has a complex relationship with the A.I. community
[[Sam Shead]] wrote this article for [[CNBC]].

> [!summary] Summary
> [[Elon Musk]] provided the initial funding for OpenAI, but has not served any role in its leadership since 2018.

## Notes
> Rather awkwardly, OpenAI has tried to distance itself from Musk and his AI comments on numerous occasions. OpenAI employees don’t always like to see “Elon Musk’s OpenAI” in headlines, for example. 
>
> Musk resigned from the board of OpenAI in February 2018 but he continued to share his punchy views on where AI is headed in public forums.
>
> A spokesperson for OpenAI said he left the board to avoid future conflicts with Tesla.
