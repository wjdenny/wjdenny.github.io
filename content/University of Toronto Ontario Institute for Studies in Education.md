The PhD in Higher Education looks interesting.

It says the program is 4 years and includes 4 years of funding averaging 25k per year. Tuition seems pretty low also, if I understood correctly.

Though it says 6 courses ("half courses"), a comprehensive exam, and a thesis. Am I missing something, or are Canadian PhD quite different?

> Applicants who hold an MEd or other non-thesis master's degree must submit written evidence of their ability to define a research question or problem, devise a research design, and analyze and report research findings – all in an academically rigorous manner. This sample of written work may be an undergraduate  or master's thesis, long essays or papers written for master's level courses, reports and studies written as part of employment, or other documents that demonstrate the ability to conduct research at the doctoral level.

Writing admission requirement might be difficult.

> At this time, the Department of Leadership, Higher & Adult Education admits one (1) funded international applicant to its full-time Ph.D. programs each year – rotating between the programs of Adult Education & Community Development (AECD), Education Leadership & Policy (ELP), and Higher Education (HE).

So, very little chance.
