# Immigrant and Refugee ESL Students’ Challenges to Accessing Four-Year College Education: From Language Policy to Educational Policy
[[Yasuko Kanno]] and [[Manka M. Varghese]] wrote this article for [[Journal of Language, Identity & Education]].

> [!summary] Summary
> Kanno and Varghese [[@2010kanno_immigrant]] call on higher education administrators to focus their policies on all barriers to linguistic minority student success rather than only linguistic challenges.

## Notes
> what inhibits ESL students’ access to and participation in four-year college education is not simply their limited English proficiency but also the **==structural constraints== unique to this population, their ==limited financial resources==, and the students’ own ==tendency to self-eliminate==** [page 310]

> we call for a shift in higher education policy from one focusing narrowly on remediating ESL students’ limited English proficiency to a ==more comprehensive set of policies that address the structural and economic, as well as linguistic, factors== that together inhibit ESL students’ college access and participation. [page 310]

> **English as a second language (ESL) students are the fastest growing subgroup of the school-age population in the United States ([[2008 Wolf et al.|Wolf, Herman, Bachman, Bailey, & Griffin, 2008]]).** **Currently, approximately 10.3% of all students in K–12 public schools are ESL learners (National Clearinghouse for English Language Acquisition, n.d.).** The U.S. Department of Education predicts that this figure will increase to 25% of students by 2025 (Spellings, 2005). In the K–12 context, this demographic shift coupled with the impact of work by influential scholars such as Cummins (1981, 2000), Echevarria, Vogt, and Short (2000), and Thomas and Collier (1997, 2002) has generated a growing awareness among teachers and administrators that **the education of ESL students cannot be relegated to a small group of ESL specialists but needs to be addressed by schools as a whole (Oláh, 2008; van Lier, 1988)**. [page 310]

Fact sheets can be very useful: https://ncela.ed.gov/fact-sheets

I could not find the Spellings 2005 citation, but she was a U.S. Secretary of Education, and seems to be a talk that she gave.

[[The population of linguistic minority students is growing quickly]]

[[Linguistic minority students must be supported by all areas of the institution rather than be delegated to a minor department of language specialists]]

As of AY2023--24, KCC has merged its ELA tutors with the general Learning Commons and tutoring services of the college. This move is in line with this argument.

> close to 13% of the undergraduate students in the United States are nonnative speakers of English (U.S. Department of Education National Center for Education Statistics, 2000). [page 311]

Lots of useful data at https://nces.ed.gov/ too

> Colleges and universities have “adapted” to the growing linguistic diversity on campus by providing ESL students with remedial English instruction or placing them in ESL sections of the first-year writing program (Horner & Trimbur, 2002; Matsuda, 2006; Williams, 1995). **Matsuda (2006) calls this prevalent policy in U.S. higher education a “policy of linguistic containment” (p. 641) designed to quarantine linguistic differences in small sections of the college so that the rest of the college community can carry on with the “myth of linguistic homogeneity” (p. 638).** [page 311]

> Because barriers that lie between ESL students and college education are not just issues of language, a language policy narrowly focusing on remedying their “ESL problem” will have a limited impact on achieving equal college access and success for ESL students. [page 311]

> There is a great deal of heterogeneity among ESL students, and the experiences of one group of ESL students (e.g., first-generation immigrant and refugee ESL students) must not be generalized to other groups of ESL students (e.g., second- or third-generation immigrant ESL students or international ESL students) without empirical investigation. [page 311]

[[Not all linguistic minority students are the same]]

> Sociologists interested in traditionally underrepresented students’ access to higher education tend to focus on categories such as race/ethnicity (Deil-Amen & Turley, 2007; Kao & Thompson, 2003), Latinos (Arbona & Nora, 2007; Auerbach, 2004; Callahan, 2008; Nuñez, 2009; Percy Calaff, 2008; Swail, Cabrera, Lee, & Williams, 2005), socioeconomic status (Bowen, Kurzwell, & Tobin, 2005; McDonough, 1997), first-generation college students (Nuñez & Cuccaro- Alamin, 1998; Pascarella, Pierson, Wolniak, & Terenzini, 2004), and undocumented immigrants (Morales, Herrerra, & Murry, 2009). Immigrant and refugee ESL students may be subsumed under one or more of these categories but are hardly ever studied in their own right. [page 312]

> On the other hand, applied linguists and composition scholars have been studying college ESL students’ academic literacy and their experiences in ESL and composition classes (e.g., Harklau, Losey, & Siegal, 1999; Leki, 2007; Matsuda, 1999; Matsuda, Ortmeier-Hooper, & You, 2006; Roberge, Siegal, & Harklau, 2009; Shapiro, 2009; Spack, 1997; Zamel, 1995). Several of these scholars have recently questioned the tacit language policy that assumes and perpetuates English monolingualism in U.S. higher education, calling for more multilingual approaches to college composition (Horner & Trimbur, 2002; Matsuda, 2006; Tardy, 2009, November).  [page 312]

> The task, as we see it, is to develop an internationalist perspective capable of understanding the study and teaching of written English in relation to other languages and to the dynamics of globalization. (pp. 623–624) [page 312]

> through her case studies of three immigrant ESL students’ transitions from high school to community college, Harklau (2000) argued that how institutions represent a particular group of students has a profound impact on the students’ learning and survival in these institutions [page 312]

> our study, building on Harklau’s research, aims to examine ESL students’ transitions to a four-year university. [page 312] 

> whereas most community colleges have an open-door policy (Rao, 2004), entry into four-year institutions typically involves a selection process. [page 312]

> academic demands are higher at four-year institutions than in community colleges (Kirst, 2004). [page 312]

> tuition and fees for four-year colleges and universities are on average higher than those for two-year colleges (College Board, 2007). [page 312]

> We have found Bourdieu’s theory of cultural reproduction to offer a useful theoretical perspective from which to gain an understanding of ESL students’ challenges to accessing four-year college education. Bourdieu (1977a) argues that schools contribute to the reproduction of existing power relations in society by privileging the cultural background of students of the dominant class. Since the culture and values of the dominant class are accessible only to those who belong to the dominant class, working-class and minority students are inherently disadvantaged: “By doing away with giving explicitly to everyone what it implicitly demands of everyone, the educational system demands of everyone alike that they have what it does not give” (Bourdieu, 1977a, p. 494). Bourdieu and Passeron (1990) argue that schools commit symbolic violence to working-class and poor students by privileging the culture of the middle class as if it were inherently more valuable than the cultures of the working class and the poor. [page 313]

[[1992 Bourdieu & Wacquant - An invitation to reflexive sociology]]

> Central to Bourdieu’s theory of cultural reproduction is the notion of cultural capital, which is comprised of the kinds of knowledge, dispositions, and educational qualifications that are highly valued in a particular social milieu (1986). Linguistic capital, competence in a socially powerful language, is often considered a subset of cultural capital (1977b). ESL students have a distinct disadvantage compared with their native-English-speaking peers in the U.S. education context because they lack the linguistic capital central to educational success. Cultural capital is intimately related to other forms of capital such as economic capital (money and property), symbolic capital (status and legitimacy), and social capital (networks and connections) (Bourdieu, 1986, 1991; Swartz, 1997). Students with low-level resources in these forms of capital, such as ESL students, are likely to start their education with considerable disadvantages and exit from the educational system with smaller gains in cultural capital than their English-speaking, middle-class counterparts. [page 313]

[[Linguistic minority students are disadvantaged compared to linguistic majority students due to their fluency with an effective form of cultural capital]]

> In order for schools’ imposition of the dominant culture on all students to work, it requires students’ acquiescence. Bourdieu’s notion of habitus (1977b; Bourdieu & Passeron, 1990) helps explain students’ acceptance of the status quo. Habitus refers to class-based ideas of one’s place in the world. Schools succeed in cultural reproduction not because they unilaterally impose dominance on the oppressed class, but because members of the oppressed class internalize their inferiority. As we will see later, some ESL students also internalize their inferiority by subscribing to the primacy of English competence in U.S. higher education. [page 313]

Kanno & Varghese's explanation of Bourdieu's *habitus* seems to be different from the word I understood used by [[Asao Inoue]].

RESUME HERE

> At NGU, which is the flagship public university in the state in which it is located, any non-U.S.-citizens whose first language is not English must enroll in the university’s ESL program unless they can demonstrate their English proficiency with standardized test scores: Students must obtain either a minimum score of 490 on the SAT critical reading or 70 on the TOEFL iBT. Upon arrival, they take the in-house placement test at the university’s ESL center, and on the basis of the test results, they can be either exempted from the English language requirement or placed in any one of the five levels of ESL courses. According to the director of the Campus ESL Programs, 388 students were enrolled in the ESL program in Fall 2006 (see Table 1). More than half of the students were placed in the first two levels. If a student is placed in ESL Level 1, the student is required to take all five classes and pass an exam at the end of each course. The ESL courses are non-credit bearing. Students take ESL courses and their regular undergraduate courses concurrently, but they must register for their ESL course each quarter before they can register for their undergraduate courses. Also, the ESL courses do not replace the required freshman composition course: students are required to take the freshman composition course in addition to the ESL courses. [page 314]

This can serve as an example of how to describe an ESL program.

> we interviewed 33 students. [page 314]

> We defined low-income students in terms of those who were receiving the Federal Pell Grant. [page 314]

> qualitative interviews, focusing on ESL students’ college application process and academic and social experiences at NGU. In order to make comparisons across students, we used an interview protocol; at the same time, we also modified our questions in each interview to explore the unique circumstances of each participant. [page 315]

> e also interviewed seven university administrators and instructors who were centrally involved in the admission and instruction of ESL students on campus: an admissions officer who was in charge of ESL students’ admission to the university; the director of the first-year writing programs; the director of writing for the College of Arts and Sciences; an academic advisor of the Educational Opportunity Program; the past and present directors of the Campus ESL Programs; and the testing coordinator for the ESL programs.  [page 315--316]

> We first coded the data for salient themes across participants using Atlas-ti. [page 316]

What is Atlas-ti?

> we identified four categories of challenges that the ESL students in our sample experienced: (1) linguistic challenges, (2) structural constraints, (3) financial struggles, and (4) self-censorship.  [page 316]

> it is important to point out that the students considered these linguistic problems to be within their control. [page 317]

> it is important to point out that the students considered these linguistic problems to be within their control. [page 317]

> structural challenges that were unique to ESL students. These were constraints that derived as much from the students’ limited English proficiency as they did from their institutional classification as ESL students (Callahan, 2005; Callahan, Wilkinson, & Muller, 2010). [page 318]

> Several participants voiced their frustration that only nonnative students were subjected to having to prove their linguistic preparation, when in fact being a native speaker in no way guarantees college-level academic literacy. [page 318]

> In addition, the extra tuition ESL students had to pay in order to take the ESL courses for which they received no academic credits angered many students. At the time of the data collec- tion, each of the ESL courses cost just over $1,000 in addition to the regular tuition students had to pay for their undergraduate programs. [page 318]

> Some students (though not all) told us that they found the content of the ESL classes useful. But what was taught in class was almost irrelevant in light of the overwhelming sense of resentment students brought to class because of the way in which they were placed in ESL. Referring to a similar situation at UCLA, Holten (2009) writes, “Generation 1.5 ESL students at our university tended to resent this placement. . . . Because of their resentment, they often ended up ‘resisting’ the course, the curriculum, and the teacher” (p. 171). Similarly, it was common knowledge among the staff at the NGU ESL Center that by the middle of each quarter, one third to a half of the students stop attending ESL classes only to turn up for the final exam at the end of the quarter. [page 319]

> A second problem associated with the English language requirement is the stigma that is attached to the ESL student status. Although the ESL courses were not explicitly labeled as remedial courses, both the instructors and the students knew that in fact they were. For many students we interviewed, the label “remedial student” was incongruent with the identities that they had come to claim at this stage of their academic careers in the United States. Most of the students were considered academic achievers back in their home country and/or in high school; some identified themselves as star students. Since many of their parents immigrated to the United States with a goal of providing them with a better education, doing well in school was an important aspect of the identities of these students. They were proud of having been admitted into NGU despite linguistic, racial, and financial barriers. Moreover, even though they had been institutionally categorized as ESL students at some point prior to coming to NGU, many of them had been exited from an ESL program. As evidence of their academic success, they noted that they had successfully taken Advanced Placement courses in high school or that they received As in regular freshman composition classes in community college. Thus, many regarded their de facto reclassification as ESL students as a message from the university that they were somehow less than full-fledged members of the university community. Mike, a student from Taiwan who had a strong academic record, remarked: 
> 
> > When I got the, the acceptance letter—OK, I’m going to go Northern Green University like a normal student. So I was kind of like prepared to do some a little bit heavier load, you know, without ESL, in my goal attending aerospace [engineering]. And like all of sudden when I was registering, they said I have to take this [ESL] class. I was kind of, um, a little bit disappointed, and I thought, oh, I thought you accepted me. Maybe, I should not like to be in this program.
> 
> Thus, ironically although the ESL program was meant to facilitate ESL students’ academic success in their undergraduate education, it was perceived by many ESL students as a major hindrance to their participation and legitimacy in the university. [page 319]

> The latest statistics show that the median family income for school-age ESL students is $36,691 while that of non-ESL students is $60,280 (“A distinctive population,” 2009). [page 320]

Where can I find more detailed income data like this?

> 15 students responded that being an ESL student was the biggest barrier. But the sec- ond most frequently chosen factor was that of being a low-income student (See Table 4). Many of these students originally came from a middle-class background in their countries of origin. Twenty of the 33 students reported that their parents had middle-class or upper-middle-class occupations back home. Sixteen of them had at least one college-educated parent. For a major- ity of the students, it was such middle-class upbringing and habitus that put college education squarely on their horizon. Out of the 33 participants, 24 said that they had always intended to attend a four-year university. 
> 
> However, when they immigrated to the United States, many families experienced an economic downturn because the parents did not speak fluent English, as Melanie pointed out: 
> 
> > As you know my parents, like my daddy not working right now and my mom working but she doesn’t get high pay or great pay so I’m getting financial aid and I think most of the ESL students’ parents cannot get great job in the United States because they don’t speak English well. So, they chances hard to, harder than other normal Americans.
> 
> [page 320]

> twelve students reported that their families experienced downward mobility when they immigrated to the United States, whereas not a single student reported that their family was economically better off as a result of immigration. In sum, the students’ original middle-class upbringing and their solid education back home landed them at NGU; yet, many lacked the economic capital to support their education. [page 320]

> Financial constraints also seemed to have a subtle but prevalent impact on students’ choice of majors and careers. Because the immigrant and refugee ESL students had seen their parents struggle, they seemed to gravitate toward majors that would lead to well-defined, highly remuner- ated professions, such as business, medicine, and engineering (Kiang, 1992). Anna, a Ukrainian student, described this child-of-immigrant mindset [page 321]

> the students in this study tended to think of university as a stepping stone to a specific career. This was in sharp contrast to the common middle-class notion of college as “a time and space where students are safe to experiment with ideas about themselves and their world [and] where they can fail and recover” (Beyer, Gillmore, & Fisher, 2007, p. 58). [page 321]

> Most students were acutely aware of their nonnative-speaker status, and this identity often held them back in taking advantage of opportunities and resources. The confining effects of what may be called “ESL habitus”—the propensity for self-censorship because of one’s ESL status—were real. In the first place, many students noted that ESL students simply self-eliminate from applying to four-year universities because they assume that they would not be admitted, or that even if they were admitted, they would feel overwhelmed by the enormity of the challenges ahead. Clearly, the students we interviewed were either not afflicted with such self-doubt or learned to overcome it along the way because they in fact came to NGU. However, many knew other ESL students who eliminated themselves without trying, as Shammy, a Vietnamese student, explained: 
> 
> > Most of the ESL, you know, student they just think about go to community college. Just like some of them really rare though think about going to university. Yeah, ’cause I have three, I mean two friends here in high school here. And they also think about going to community college. They never think about going to university.

> Even after they entered university, the sense of intimidation continued for some students. Many of our participants reported that they were intimidated to speak up or ask questions in a large class. Although this may be typical of most freshman students (Beyer et al., 2007), ESL students’ hesitation came from their self-consciousness about English (Leki, 2007). [page 322]

> > When I’m in English [i.e., ESL] class, I’m always comfortable. I can ask anything I want, I can say anything I want. You know what I mean? But in nursing class, I get scared to ask question and you know what if I say something wrong and what if they teacher say something. And that will make me a little embarrass so I don’t even ask question, mostly.
> 
> [page 322]

> Students who transferred from community colleges acutely felt a shift in the expected stan- dards. They said that they had felt comfortable asking English language questions in community colleges but hesitated to do so at NGU. Jason, a Vietnamese student, explained: 
> 
> > I think a lot of people who go to [community] college [are] just average people. You know. Maybe like people here are more smart. And if you go ask something like, they think it’s so basic, maybe you not really intelligent, you know.
> 
> [page 322]

> In the theoretical framework, we noted that the process of cultural reproduction requires students’ acquiescence. Here we can see an ESL student acquiescing to the university’s institutional culture that frames the lack of native-level English proficiency as a deficit. Community colleges accept a number of ESL and academically underprepared students; Jason is saying that among such “average people,” it is acceptable to ask questions related to the English language—but not at the university. Rather than questioning the underlying cultural norms that privilege native speakers’ linguistic capital and ignore ESL students’ multilingual competence, Jason has internalized this deficit orientation and associates her lack of native-level proficiency with shame. As Bourdieu (Bourdieu & Wacquant, 1992) states, “Symbolic violence, to put it as tersely and simply as possible, is the violence which is exercised upon a social agent with his or her complicity” (p. 167, emphasis added). [page 322]

> ESL habitus does not concern only academic domains; it may affect ESL students’ social- ization patterns even more. Of the 33 students we interviewed, only 5 identified themselves as actively involved in student organizations, while 17 had no involvement in any organizations. This was in part because of a lack of time: Commuting long distances from home, working at their part-time jobs, and/or studying for many extra hours left little time for socialization. But it was also because ESL students hesitated to participate in what they perceived as the “main- stream” social networks on campus. Melanie commented, “Most of the ESL students are not participating to the any sports or events like something like that ’cause they have a hardship with speaking and like socializing. So they don’t tend to be involved in anything." [page 322]

> In the absence of native-English-speaking friends, many ESL students turned to coethnics for social support. Christina explained how coethnic friends become a default backup for ESL college students: 
> 
> > It’s a lot easier for me to make friends with Chinese people somehow. . . . And it’s a lot harder for me to make friends with American people because it’s just every time I talk, I worry about like, do they understand me or not, do they really want to talk to you. It’s just that I don’t know if people can understand my culture or not. It’s a challenge to try to talk to them.
> 
> [page 323]

> We do not regard ESL students’ association with their coethnics negatively. Access to coethnic networks is in fact an important form of social capital (Portes & Rumbaut, 2001; Rumbaut, 1997): It was through coethnic friends that many of our participants learned which courses to take, where to get financial aid information, and how to navigate the university system. However, our data indicate that many ESL students relied on coethnics not necessarily out of choice but because they perceived English-speaking social networks as inaccessible. [page 323]

> these challenges derive less from ESL students’ lack of sufficient English proficiency per se than from their institutional, sociocultural, and material disadvantages. [page 323]

> it is not our intent to underestimate the linguistic challenges of ESL students in college. Our participants discussed their linguistic problems, most notably their difficulty understanding the content of the required reading, unfamiliarity with specialized vocab- ulary, general difficulty with writing, and the extra time it takes to complete academic work in an L2. At the same time, most of the students considered these linguistic challenges to be within their own control: as long as they studied harder and put in extra effort, they were able to live with these challenges. In contrast, the challenges that were outside of their control and there- fore perceived as barriers to their college education were nonlinguistic. We have identified three such areas of challenges: institutional constraints that apply only to ESL students, limited finan- cial resources, and the ESL student habitus that leads them to self-eliminate because of their perceived lack of legitimacy as full members of the university community. [page 323]

> Limited English proficiency may be the most salient feature of this population, but that does not necessarily mean that their English proficiency is the only factor that inhibits their college access. ESL student is a com- posite of many attributes, as Bennici and Strang (1995) point out: “Being LEP [limited English proficient] as a high school-age youth in this country generally means you are also poorer, older, and more likely to be from a minority group” than native speakers (p. 33, emphasis added). Any of these attributes of ESL students may present as many roadblocks as, or even more roadblocks than, limited English proficiency itself on their pathways to four-year colleges. If we are to facil- itate ESL students’ access to, and participation in, four-year college education, we need to pay attention to all of these factors, rather than focusing narrowly on their linguistic challenges. [page 323--324]

> Valdés (1997) calls such a simplistic approach “offer[ing] narrow solutions to far broader problems” (p. 410). [page 324]

> Valdés argues that the dis- advantages of language minority students in U.S. schools derive chiefly, not from their limited English, but from the fundamentally unequal power structures in which these students are framed as having deficits. Simply increasing the amount of instruction in their L1 by offering them dual-language immersion programs will not alleviate language minority students’ educational problems. In the same way, focusing exclusively on ESL students’ limited academic literacy without addressing the extremely uneven playing field on which they are expected to compete with native-speaking students is not likely to broaden college access to more ESL students. [page 324]

> We do believe that linguistic support should be provided to ESL college students. However, ESL education in college must not be punitive. As Benesch (1988) argues, “To move away from a skills or remedial approach to teaching is not to deny that our students need language courses” (pp. 1–2). Alternatives to remedial-model ESL programs include a separate ESL track of the freshman composition course, integrating ESL students into regular composition classes with instructors who are aware of the needs of L2 writers, and optional ESL courses for specific skill areas for which ESL students can voluntarily sign up (see Holten [2009] for UCLA’s attempt to create a separate ESL composition class with students participating in their placement decision). For all these options, we strongly propose that ESL students be given academic credits, as has been recommended by both TESOL (1987) and the Conference on College Composition and Communication (CCCC Committee on Second Language Writing, 2001), and not be charged disproportionately high tuition. Requiring ESL students to take remedial courses that bear no academic credits sends them a strong message that they have arrived at the university with a deficit. ESL students need linguistic support not because they have a deficit but “because, unlike their native counterparts, they have not had twelve years of schooling in English” (Benesch, 1988, p. 2). [page 324]

> In addition to providing ESL students with intensive but nonpunitive linguistic support, we believe that we as language educators need to make a more concerted effort to spread the notion that every teacher is a language teacher among college faculty. It is important to note that some progress has been made in this regard. CCCC issued a statement in 2001, calling for writing teachers and program administrators to better address the needs of L2 writers in the con- text of college composition (CCCC Committee on Second Language Writing, 2001). Several composition scholars now strongly advocate multilingualism as the ideal norm, promoting the use of non-English languages in composition classes (Horner & Trimbur, 2002; Tardy, 2009, November). Also, some college professors do make a concerted effort to address ESL students’ literacy needs in their content courses and treat their multilingual and multicultural knowledge as cultural capital (e.g., Alster, 2004; Fishman & McCarthy, 2004; Sieber, 2004). [page 324--325]

What is this?

> one professor in nursing did not hesitate to tell the author, “I don’t want them [i.e., ESL students] in my class unless they’re at the right level because they can’t pass my classes” (p. 94; see also Zamel, 1995, for similar findings). When professors make a comment like this, the underlying assumption is that the onus is on the ESL students to improve their English before they can take content courses. [page 325]

> Is it not high time, then, that college instructors stopped blaming ESL students for their inability to learn and started questioning their inability to teach one fifth to one quarter of the student body (Cummins, 2000)? [page 325]

> It is also important to remember that providing linguistic support, either in ESL-specific classes or as an institution as a whole, will not solve ESL students’ nonlinguistic challenges. For these challenges, a more holistic approach is necessary. For instance, many U.S. colleges and universities have outreach programs targeting racial minority and/or low-income students in secondary schools that are designed to help them aspire to college and facilitate the actual application process (Tierney & Hagedorn, 2002). Once they are in college, many four-year institutions follow up with these same groups of students by enrolling them in support services programs such as educational opportunity programs. Currently, very few such programs specifically target the ESL population. However, ESL students would benefit from explicit encouragement to consider college during secondary school and also from ongoing and hands-on support during college just as much as racial minority and low-income students. Since colleges and universities already have these programs in place, it would not be an enormous stretch for them to include ESL students as another category of students that they would specifically target. [page 325]
