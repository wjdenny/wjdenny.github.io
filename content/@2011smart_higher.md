## Rhetorical Précis
%% Review a [description of rhetorical précis from Cuyamaca College](https://www.cuyamaca.edu/student-support/tutoring-center/files/student-resources/rhetorical-precis-description-and-examples.pdf). %%

%%
[Dr. Pacheco-Vega], in [his blog article] titled "[Triaging your reading workload]" ([2019]), argues that [the ways in which we decide when to read an article in more depth can and should vary by individuals and is best learned by experience]. [He] supports this claim by [providing examples of techniques that work for him but others have claimed are not effective as well as vice versa] and finally [encouraging readers to develop their own guidelines for deciding what merits further reading]. [Pachecho-Vega]'s purpose is to [show how to more effectively process reading workloads] in order to [help students and researchers make better decisions about what to read in more depth]. [He] adopts [an informal tone] for the readers of [his blog] and others interested in the topic of [knowledge management].
