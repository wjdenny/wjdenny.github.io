# Some blogging myths

## Notes
> The idea is that if I found it confusing, lots of other people probably did too, even though the information might theoretically be out there on the internet somewhere. Just because there is information on the internet, it doesn’t get magically teleported into people’s brains!
 
The same idea would apply to teaching, too.
[[Just because the information already exists somewhere, doesn't mean it isn't worth writing about]]

> Sometimes when I write a blog post, someone will link me to a great existing explanation of the thing that I hadn’t seen. I try to think of this as a good thing – it means that I get a new resource that I couldn’t find, and maybe other people find out about it too. Often I’ll update the blog post to link to it.
 
It's okay if someone later shares a resource that you didn't know about in response to your writing. It just means that now you know about it!

> technology changes, and the details matter. Maybe the exact details about how to do something have changed in the last 5 years, and there isn’t much written about the situation in 2023!

Don't forget that times change, especially interfaces, so it's always useful to have updated writing about something.

> You actually just need to know 1-2 interesting things that the reader doesn’t. And if you just learned the thing yesterday, it’s certain that lots of other people don’t know it either.

You don't need to be an expert; you just need to know a few things that someone else doesn't.

> I do tend to overdo the “I think that…” statements a bit (bad habit!) and sometimes I need to edit them out when actually it’s something I’m 100% sure of.

Add qualifiers if you're not certain about the information, but only then.

> The reality of publishing things on the internet is that interesting things get boosted, and boring things get ignored. So people are basically guaranteed to think your posts are much more interesting that they actually are, because they’re more likely to see your interesting posts.

[[The nature of internet content removes a lot of risk of failure when writing because uninteresting content gets ignored quietly]]

> I really Darius Kazemi’s How I Won The Lottery talk on this topic about how putting things on the internet is like buying lots of lottery tickets, and the best way to “win” is to make a lot of stuff.

Just produce more; don't try to figure out what will be successful.

> The problem is that you end up writing something that feels like it wasn’t written for anyone: beginners will get confused (it’s very hard to bring someone from “I have no idea what memory allocation is” to “in depth notes about the internals of malloc” in a single blog post), and more advanced readers will be bored and put off by the overly basic explanations.

Identify a specific target when you write.

> I found that the easiest way to start was to pick one person and write for them.

You can always write another post for a different type of person.

> writing has gotten harder as I get more experienced
> 
> Someone who read this mentioned that they feel like writing has gotten harder as they get more experienced, and I feel the same way.
> 
> I think this is because the gap between me and who I’m writing for has gotten a bigger over time, and so it gets a little harder for me to relate to people who know less about the topic. I think on the balance having more experience makes my writing better (I have more perspective!), but it feels harder.
> 
> I don’t have any advice to give about this right now. I just want to acknowledge that it’s hard because someone who read a draft of this mentioned it.

I also feel this in teaching English as a second language as a native speaker. It's hard. I should also reflect on this idea. I suspect that writing more about a large-gap topic like that might be helpful.
