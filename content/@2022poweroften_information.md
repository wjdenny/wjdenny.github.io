## Notes
> [Andy Polaine] there was mostly men sort of there saying, Yeah, you know, we just didn’t really kind of think anyone was gonna use it this way. And I was really shocked. And and I just, I had this kind of response to it of how could you possibly not have at least gone through the exercise of thinking, how might someone use this nefariously? You know, because that seems to be a fundamental, it’s my favourite critique tactic with my students is, you know, they’ve got a service concept in front of them. And they’re saying, Well, you know, what happens if I do this? And what happens if I do that? How about if I break this? And then they’re like, oh, but we don’t think people would do that. But of course, someone will.

> [Andy Polaine] And there’s this analogy that Steve Jobs made famous, this notion that computers are bicycles for the mind, yeah, that they allow us to do things that we would not be able to do before, in much the same way that a bicycle allows us to leverage our body’s energy very powerfully, right.
