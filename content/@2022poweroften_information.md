## Rhetorical Précis
%% Review a [description of rhetorical précis from Cuyamaca College](https://www.cuyamaca.edu/student-support/tutoring-center/files/student-resources/rhetorical-precis-description-and-examples.pdf). %%

%%
[Dr. Pacheco-Vega], in [his blog article] titled "[Triaging your reading workload]" ([2019]), argues that [the ways in which we decide when to read an article in more depth can and should vary by individuals and is best learned by experience]. [He] supports this claim by [providing examples of techniques that work for him but others have claimed are not effective as well as vice versa] and finally [encouraging readers to develop their own guidelines for deciding what merits further reading]. [Pachecho-Vega]'s purpose is to [show how to more effectively process reading workloads] in order to [help students and researchers make better decisions about what to read in more depth]. [He] adopts [an informal tone] for the readers of [his blog] and others interested in the topic of [knowledge management].

## Notes
> [Andy Polaine] there was mostly men sort of there saying, Yeah, you know, we just didn’t really kind of think anyone was gonna use it this way. And I was really shocked. And and I just, I had this kind of response to it of how could you possibly not have at least gone through the exercise of thinking, how might someone use this nefariously? You know, because that seems to be a fundamental, it’s my favourite critique tactic with my students is, you know, they’ve got a service concept in front of them. And they’re saying, Well, you know, what happens if I do this? And what happens if I do that? How about if I break this? And then they’re like, oh, but we don’t think people would do that. But of course, someone will.

> [Andy Polaine] And there’s this analogy that Steve Jobs made famous, this notion that computers are bicycles for the mind, yeah, that they allow us to do things that we would not be able to do before, in much the same way that a bicycle allows us to leverage our body’s energy very powerfully, right.
