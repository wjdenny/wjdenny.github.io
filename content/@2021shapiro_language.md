# Language and Social Justice

> [!summary] Summary
> [[Shawna Shapiro|Shapiro]] presents a case where students completed and improved a plurilingual-designed course.

## Notes
> a case of first-year seminar in which *students themselves* have helped to shift the course in an increasingly plurilingual direction. (page 15)

It was already designed as a plurilingual course; the students just did what they were asked.

> **the course was designed to meet the needs of multilingual writers and to treat language difference as an asset** (e.g, [[2002 Canagarajah|Canagarajah, 2002]]; [[2006 Matsuda|Matsuda, 2006]]) (page 15)

> student-centered "teaching for agency" ([[Shapiro, et al. (2016)|Shapiro, Shuck, Cox, & Simnitt, 2016]]) (page 15)

> At Middlebury, we do not collect much data in students' language spoken at home. However, my analysis of institutional data suggests that *at least* 10% of our domestic students use a language other than English at home. Although more than half (55%) of our students receive some form of need-based financial aid, the student body overall is fairly well-off; most of our students come from middle- and upper-middle class households. However, we do have a growing number of students who are the first in their families to attend a four-year college-- approximately 15% of the student body. (page 16)

> our incoming first-years are required to take a First Year Seminar (FYS), rather than a course in First Year Composition. (page 16)

> Middlebury does not have an intensive English program or any other designated courses for multilingual/L2 writers. This is typical at small liberal arts colleges, which tend to hire specialists to support students within heterogenous courses, rather than to have courses designated for particular groups-- e.g., ESL or developmental/remedial writing. (page 17)

> Critical Language Awareness or CLA (e.g., [[1999 Clark & Ivani훾|Clark & Ivani훾, 1999]]; [[1992 Fairclough|Fairclough, 1992]]/[[2014 Fairclough|2014]]). **A CLA approach to writing pedagogy, as I define it, invites students into deep conversations about intersections of language and power, giving them the tools to examine how these intersections play out in a variety of social and cultural contexts** ([[n.d. Shapiro|Shapiro, in progress]]; see also [[2005 Alim|Alim, 2005]]; [[1999 Clark & Ivani훾|Clark & Ivani훾, 1999]]). (page 18)

[[Critical Language Awareness explores the intersections of language and power]]

> **this approach has a great deal of conceptual and pedagogical overlap with translingual approaches to writing. Both ... treat language difference as a resource, rather than a problem. Both invite exploration of language variation in and through written texts. Both foreground students' rhetorical agency and encourage explicit negotiation between students and instructors (and among students themselves) about writerly choices** ([[Canagarajah (2013b)|Canagarajah, 2013]]; [[2013 Lu & Horner|Lu & Horner, 2013]]). (page 18)

> CLA, in my conception (e.g., [[n.d. Shapiro|Shapiro, in progress]]) is a much broader concept which can encompass a variety of approaches that predated the translingual turn in composition/writing studies, including Students' Rights to Their Own Language (e.g., [[1999 Smitherman|Smitherman, 1999]]) and Critical English for Academic Purposes (e.g., [[2009 Benesch|Benesch, 2009]]). (page 18)

What is the line between encouraging students to use their own language, and using multiple languages of instruction in each class?

**> translingual pedagogy often highlights students' *resistance* to academic norms and linguistic standards as an educational goal (although some scholars have problematized this**-- e.g., [[2013 Lu & Horner|Lu & Horner, 2013]]; [[2018 Schreiber & Watson|Schreiber & Watson, 2018]]). (page 18)

I'm not sure I understand this. TP focuses on students not wanting to use academic English or adapt to academic culture?

[[Translingual pedagogy focuses on resistance to linguistic standardization in academia]]

> **CLA pedagogy focuses more on building students' metalinguistic understanding of *how and why* those norms persist** (page 18)

Ah, maybe it means TP focuses more on helping students resist the dominance of Anglo culture and language in academia.

> The primary course texts, however, are Rosina Lippi-Green's *English with an Accent* ([[2012 Lippi-Green|2nd edition, 2012]]) and Richard Rodriguez's autobiography *Hunger of Memory* ([[1982 Rodriguez|1982]]). (page 19)

> Rodriguez's book was added in part to give students the opportunity to push against Lippi-Green; Rodriguez, who grew up in a Spanish-speaking household, has been a public critic of bilingual education and tends to promote an assimilationist viewpoint toward linguistic, cutural, and racial difference. (page 19)

> past syllabi for this course are available on my website: <http://sites.middlebury.edu/shapiro/> (page 19)

> I realized over time that I had succumbed to **linguistic prejudices of my own in assuming that the L1 English users were "monolingual."** (page 21)

> **students from the "Deep South" of the U.S. who spoke powerfully about the stigma against a "Southern drawl"** (page 22)

[[Students come to the classroom with a range of communicative and technological abilities and educational experiences]]
[[Even students who speak only English often speak a variety of dialects of English besides the academic standard]]

> **students with Latinx or East Asian backgrounds who felt marginalized among their peers because they are not fluent in the languages affiliated with their ethnic background** (e.g., Spanish or Korean). (page 22)

> U.S. born student who played on the college baseball team, talked frequently in class about how athletes build camaraderie using specialized humor, slang, and other linguistic strategies. (page 22)

> U.S. born student who planned to become a medical doctor in the future, once brought up the idea that gendered language in introductory biology textbooks (such as representations of the sperm as "active" and the egg as "passive") reinforces sexist stereotypes. (page 22)

> Sarah's use of Cantonese was not just a reminder to the reader of her multilingual background; it demonstrated linguistic agency and audience awareness as well.  (page 25)

> [[Cenoz & Gorter (2013)]], **a pluralistic orientation recognizes that all speakers "use a repertoire of communicative resources for different functions"** (p. 594)  (page 26)

[[Plurilingualism accepts that everyone uses a variety of language or dialectal resources for different purposes]]

> Many scholar-practitioners now concur that the central aim of **"translingual pedagogy" is the cultivation of what [[Lorimer Leonard (2014)]] calls "rhetorical attunement"-- regardless of which languages or codes students choose to employ.** (page 26)

> "How do you grade it?" Over time, I have found two interrelated strategies that work: First, I grade primarily on process, rather than product. Second, I interact with students throughout the process, using scaffolding assignments (proposals, drafts, reflections, etc.) and individual meetings. In our interactions, we negotiate what students need to do in order to meet their rhetorical goals, as well as my learning goals for the assignment, as has been recommended by other scholars (e.g., [[Canagarajah (2013b)|Canagarajah, 2013]]). (page 27)

> **student-driven approach to plurilingual pedagogy can be seen as an iteration of "teaching for agency" ([[Shapiro, et al. (2016)|Shapiro, Cox, Shuck, & Simnitt, 2016]]),** i.e., **an educational intervention that empowers all students to make informed choices. If agency is, as [[Lu & Horner (2013)]] argue, at the core of translingual pedagogy, perhaps allowing students to take the lead is even more appropriate than making the choice for them.** (page 28)

[[Translingual pedagogy aims to develop students' agency in their communicative abilities]]

> **rather than asking the question "What should *I do* to make my course more plurilingual?" we might ask "Where can *I invite students* to make this course more plurilingual?"** When we think of plurilingual pedagogy as inclusive of *all students'* linguistic repertoires (including those traditionally thought of as "monolingual" or "L1 English"), **our courses can become linguistic "contact zones" (e.g., [[1991 Pratt|Pratt, 1991]]; [[2002 Wolff|Wolff, 2002]]), where all students reflect deeply on their relationship to language and learn from their peers' reflections as well.** (page 28)
