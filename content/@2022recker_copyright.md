# U.S. Copyright Office Rules A.I. Art Can’t Be Copyrighted
[[Jane Recker]] wrote this article for [[Smithsonian Magazine]].

> [!summary] Summary
> U.S. law does not directly prevent AI work from being copyrighted, but there is a precedent. It should be noted that this is not the case in other countries, and this may pose issues for international copyright agreements.

## Notes
> U.S. copyright law doesn’t explicitly outline rules for non-humans, but case precedent has led courts to be “consistent in finding that non-human expression is ineligible for copyright protection,” the board says in its February 14 decision. The decision points out previous lower-court rulings, such as a [1997 decision](https://web.law.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/microsites/gender-sexuality/Ventimiglia_Paper.pdf) that found a book of supposed divine revelations lacked an element of human arrangement and curation necessary for protection and a [2018 ruling](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/24/17271410/monkey-selfie-naruto-slater-copyright-peta) that concluded a monkey could not sue for copyright infringement.

> Other countries put less emphasis on the necessity of human authorship for protection. A judge in Australia [ruled last year](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/australian-judge-rules-inventions-6431529/) A.I.-created inventions can qualify for patent protection. And South Africa allowed Thaler [to patent](https://artificialinventor.com/first-patent-granted-to-the-artificial-inventor-project/) one of his products last year, noting that “the invention was autonomously generated by an artificial intelligence.” While Thaler owns the patent, the A.I. is listed as the inventor.

U.S. law does not directly prevent AI work from being copyrighted, but there is a precedent that requires human authorship.
