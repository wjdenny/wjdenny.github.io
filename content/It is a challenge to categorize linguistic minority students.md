It is a challenge to categorize linguistic minority students. [[None of the terms used to describe linguistic minority students can adequately describe the range of identities and backgrounds these students have]] The term bilingual or multilingual became common as a way to center the assets that linguistic minority students bring to the classroom[^1]. The term linguistic minority is used in higher education and applied linguistic contexts to describe students who speak a language other than English at home in English-dominant societies.[^1] Terms such as English language learners (ELLs) and limited English proficient (LEP) are commonly used in K-12 education but focus primarily on the deficits of students.[^1] The term *limited English proficient* is also used in Title IX. Technically terms like ESL, ELL, and LEP only describe students who are currently in those support programs and not once they leave or no longer "limited". The lack of standard terminology to categorize these students presents issues in research where [[Linguistic minority students are largely invisible in research on underrepresented populations in higher education]] There are also ethical considerations, in that [[Labelling people into specific roles can limit their ability to utilize their skills and talents]]
