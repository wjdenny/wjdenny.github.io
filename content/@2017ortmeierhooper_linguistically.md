Part II
> The Upward Bound (UB) program referenced in Wight's chapter is part of the federally funded TRIO programs designed to "identify and provided services for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds" (U.S. Department of Education). In recent years, such programs have seen significant budgetary cuts-- over $65 million from 2007 to 2014. [page 96]

> Within the United States, it is estimated that there are over 1.4 million undocumented high school and college-age youth, even though many have lived and gone to school in the U.S. since kindergarten (Passel & Lopez, 2012). [page 96]

> policy debates play real and concrete roles in the ways in which resident ML youth are able to pursue higher education or not (Kanno & Harklau, 2012). García de Müeller examines the U.S. DREAM Act, a legislative proposal that would allow undocumented students to gain provisional status, attend college, and be eligible for loans and financial assistance. She then explores how these Dreamer students, as writers, use digital media and tools to construct and speak back to one another and policy that guides their fates. [page 96]

Focus on the positive! How were things like the U.S. DREAM Act, TRIO programs, and desegregation fought for and won? What lessons can be applied to issues I'm aware of?
