# OpenAI’s attempts to watermark AI text hit limits

> Watermarks on AI-generated content will not work for all platforms and will be easy to remove.

## Notes
> Unaffiliated academics and industry experts, however, shared mixed opinions. They note that the tool is server-side, meaning it wouldn’t necessarily work with all text-generating systems. And they argue that it’d be trivial for adversaries to work around.

> Yoav Shoham, the co-founder and co-CEO of [AI21 Labs](https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/12/openai-rival-ai21-labs-raises-64m-to-ramp-up-its-ai-powered-language-services/), an OpenAI rival, doesn’t think that statistical watermarking will be enough to help identify the source of AI-generated text. He calls for a “more comprehensive” approach that includes differential watermarking, in which different parts of text are watermarked differently and AI systems that more accurately cite the sources of factual text.
