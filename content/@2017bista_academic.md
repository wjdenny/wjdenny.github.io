	abstract = {University instructors address and want to eschew student academic misconduct. These educators presume that students understand fully what cheating and plagiarism are. However, the issue of academic dishonesty among international students is complex and difficult. This study investigated the perceptions of international undergraduate and graduate students in a southern U.S. university about possible causes for academic misbehavior. Results reveal several causal variables: previous learning style, English language proficiency, unfamiliarity with American academic cultures, relationship between student and teacher, and availability of technical and educational resources associated with academic dishonesty.},

## Rhetorical PrÃ©cis

## Notes
> Academic misconduct is more prevalent among international students than students educated in English-speaking countries (Arkoudis, 2007; Park, 2003). [[Resources/Articles/2011 Bista - Academic Dishonesty Among International Students in Higher Education.pdf#page=1|page 159]]

[[Non-native English speaking students are more likely to violate academic integrity policies]]

> Some researchers have suggested that academic honesty offenses may result from misunderstanding of course policy or definitions of misbehavior such as plagiarism rather than a deliberate intention to cheat (Bamford & Sergiou, 2005; Evans & Youmans, 2000). Broadly speaking, scholars have categorized plagiarism into two groups: intentional and unintentional (Bamford & Sergiou, 2005; Hammond, 2002; Larkham & Manns, 2002; Park, 2003). [[Resources/Articles/2011 Bista - Academic Dishonesty Among International Students in Higher Education.pdf#page=2|page 160]]

[[There are two categories of plagiarism; intentional and unintentional]]

> Hall (2004) found several reasons for plagiarism, such as differing cultural values, personality factors, stress, peer pressure, and contextual factors. Studies conducted in China, Latvia, Lithuania, and the United States revealed historical, political, economic, and technical influences as major variables of plagiarism (Russikoff, Fucaloro, & Salkauskiene, 2003). [[Resources/Articles/2011 Bista - Academic Dishonesty Among International Students in Higher Education.pdf#page=2|page 160]]

> A study at the University of Alberta (2010) mentioned poor time management and organizational skills, strong home culture, pressure for scholarship and jobs, and misunderstanding of course rules and regulations leading individuals to acts of plagiarism. McCabe, Trevino, and Butterfield (2001) suggest contextual factors such as peer behavior as the most powerful influence to educational cheating. [[Resources/Articles/2011 Bista - Academic Dishonesty Among International Students in Higher Education.pdf#page=2|page 160]]

[[Peer behavior was found to be a major predictor of student cheating]]

> In many cultures, the ability of learners to integrate the words of others in harmony with one's own was considered an academic practice (Cammish, 1997). 

[[In some cultures it is standard practice to use the words of educated and enlightened figures]]

> Fleck (2000) investigated the concept of cheating in urban and rural Nepal from an ethnocentric perspective. He found that the underlying causes of cheating were grounded in Nepal's hierarchical cultural values: education is considered a status or rank rather than a process of learning, and cheat sheets, whispers, and copied answers were examination reality in many of Nepal's public schools. 

[[A study based on Nepalese students found that the implicit culture of education valued status over learning]]

> Such academic practices occur in many ethnic-oriented tribal communities, as Ballard and Clanchy (1991, cited in Hall, 2004, p. 4) explained: 
> 
> "In a Confucian, Buddhist, Hindu or Islamic society, for example, the ability to quote from sacred writings, from the saying of the ages, from the words of leading scholars, is the essence of scholarship."

[[In some cultures it is standard practice to use the words of educated and enlightened figures]]

> Nazir and Aslam (2010) studied perceptions of academic dishonesty among Pakistani undergraduate and graduate students in different universities and found that more than half of the students studied were involved in dishonest acts such as helping other students copy homework assignments, exam papers, or graded project reports. 

[[A study of Pakistani university students reported a significant majority of students copying the work of other students]]

> These students believed that cheating and copying were not serious offenses and that there was no penalty for such behaviors. 

[[Students with diverse cultural backgrounds often do not feel that copying or cheating is a problem]]

> In the Western world, knowledge acquisition is an intellectual exercise whereby one applies and manipulates information and data from various sources (Hellsten & Prescott, 2004). However, in non-Western cultures, rote learning and memorization are still widely practiced, and the degree of plagiarism is higher in graduate students than in undergraduate students due to the greater demand for critical and analytical writing (Scheyvens, Wild, & Overton, 2003). 

> Some scholars have focused on the fact that many international students have already fossilized their learning attitudes into culturally influenced beliefs and behaviors from years of schooling at their home university, and it appears they may be unable to alter those behaviors in the American classroom (Carroll, 2002; Ryan, 2000). 

[[Many students with diverse cultural backgrounds have strongly held cultural attitudes towards education and learning that may be difficult to change]]

Can I get my students to stop cheating or stop focusing on the grade?
[[How can we work with the cultural attitudes towards education and learning of non-European students;]]

> Academic attribution and the use of others' published material is greatly influenced by culture. Russikoff et al. (2003) found common economic practices in communist and post-Soviet settings to be influential in plagiarism. These researchers found students copying from each other and comparing composition lengths on a free-writing assignment in a Latvian institution of higher learning. When questioned by the researchers, students responded, "We do it this way! We always do it this way! We copy and our teachers all know we just do it!" (p. 110). Chinese students state that plagiarism and copying is "a pedagogical practice" (Russikoff et al., 2003, p. 112). Fleck (2000), studying the nature of cheating in Nepal's public schools, found that students preferred copying answers from each other in free-writing assignments. [[Resources/Articles/2011 Bista - Academic Dishonesty Among International Students in Higher Education.pdf#page=2|page 160--161]]

[[There can be a strong cultural preference for students engaging in counter-productive collaborative work]]

> The lack of English language proficiency and awareness of standard English citation conventions may contribute to plagiarism and cheating (Hyland, 2001; Park, 2003). Language barriers (Biggs & Burville, 2003) and difficulties in separating one's own thoughts from information gathered from texts and properly acknowledging the sources can also lead to plagiarism (Hall, 2004). In addition, international students may not have adequately developed such skills as essay writing, note taking, group work, and presentation, leading them to take academic shortcuts on academic tasks. Robertson, Line, Jones, and Thomas (2000) mentioned difficulties in comprehending the content of lectures, difficulties in understanding subject-specific terminology, high speed of delivery in lectures and seminars, and difficulties in interpreting the English language as reasons that international students plagiarize. [[Resources/Articles/2011 Bista - Academic Dishonesty Among International Students in Higher Education.pdf#page=3|page 161--162]]

[[Poor language proficiency is a factor in plagiarism due to the inability to internalize information]]

This could also be an interesting topic. [[How does language proficiency influence learning;]]

> The cultural difference of what constitutes public knowledge versus private knowledge is a central phenomenon of academic misconduct in some Asian and European educational settings. Some cultural groups do not regard plagiarism as a serious violation (Cammish, 1997). 

[[There can be a strong cultural preference for students engaging in counter-productive collaborative work]]

[[Students with diverse cultural backgrounds often do not feel that copying or cheating is a problem]]

> The University of Alberta (2010) suggested that 60 percent of international students interviewed stated they could not distinguish between paraphrased and plagiarized text. Carroll (2002) and Ryan (2000) highlighted the problems of such students who did not fully understand the differences among quoting, embedding sources, and plagiarism. In some cultural contexts, cheating is considered a learned behavior (Dil'ietro, 2010). For example, Italian students viewed copying from other sources as acceptable and as a mark of respect to the original author (cited in Hyland, 2001). Hammond (2002, cited in Hall, 2004, p. 1) listed the following reasons international students gave for plagiarizing: 
> 
> "I couldn't keep up with the work." 
> "The lecturer/tutor doesn't care, so why should I?" 
> "I have to succeed. Everyone expects me to succeed, and I expect it, too."
> "I don't understand what I'm expected to do to avoid plagiarism."
> "I can't do this! I will have to copy."
> "But you said, 'Work together.'"
> "But paraphrasing would be disrespectful."
> "I got desperate at the last moment." 
>

> Ryan (2000) points out that students from some cultures believe it is impolite to quote a reference or information from other sources because "this indicates that the teacher does not know that the text exists" (p. 23). Hall (2004) suggests that in any collectivist culture, the teacher determines the types of information that his or her students require to become successful. Knowledge in such cultures is considered "communal property" that anyone can use without acknowledgment (Carroll, 2002; Ryan, 2000). [[Resources/Articles/2011 Bista - Academic Dishonesty Among International Students in Higher Education.pdf#page=5|page 163]]

Interesting connection between open knowledge and communal learning. There is a movement towards open source, creative commons, and open educational resources that seems to be similar to what this text is describing other cultures do and have done in the past. Are they the same thing, though? Even with open access to research materials, we still attribute the work of others for a variety of reasons.
- credit where credit is due
- tracing our intellectual footsteps; and somewhat relatedly, acknowledging the diversity of opinions even within established literature. A scholar's name and years of publication can give a sort of shorthand of the body of knowledge that we're referencing.
- It also allows us to trace the origins of ideas and their influence on new scholarship; but why is that important to us?

> In a 1984 study at the undergraduate level, Nuss found that 53 percent of faculty surveyed indicated they rarely or never discussed university policies related to cheating and plagiarism with their students. A study by Love (1997) with six international graduate students found that they did not have any orientation experiences focused on the Ameri- can writing culture. [[Resources/Articles/2011 Bista - Academic Dishonesty Among International Students in Higher Education.pdf#page=5|page 163]]

[[Only around half of instructors incorporate plagiarism awareness into their curriculum.]]

> Psychological pressures that international students face in the process of transitioning to study in the United States are associated with academic performance and misconduct. After arrival in a new country, international students face a number of challenges in adjusting to living and learning, including culture shock and financial problems, which may have an impact on their study plans, academic motivation, and attention to assignments and course work. These adjustment problems can vary by country of origin, race, ethnicity, English language proficiency, and collective versus individualist cultural orientation (Constantine, Anderson, Berkel, Caldwell, & Utsey, 2005; Poyrazli & Grahame, 2007). [[Resources/Articles/2011 Bista - Academic Dishonesty Among International Students in Higher Education.pdf#page=6|page 164]]

How reasonable would it be then to equate their "international students" with our immigrant resident students?

> Eisenberg, Golberstein, and Gollust (2007) indicate that 37 to 84 percent of international students did not receive free counseling, mental health services, or psychotherapy. [[Resources/Articles/2011 Bista - Academic Dishonesty Among International Students in Higher Education.pdf#page=6|page 164]]

Is it that they are not being offered it, or is this a tendency for international students to not use it?

> I conducted a study of international students to answer the following questions: 
>
> - What are the major adjustment challenges for international students who are seeking academic degrees in the United States?
> - Do social, cultural, and economic issues and psychological stress make international students prone to increased rates of plagiarism?
> - Do home country teaching and learning styles contribute to documentation and citation difficulties?
> - How do international students perceive cheating and plagiarism?
>  
> [[Resources/Articles/2011 Bista - Academic Dishonesty Among International Students in Higher Education.pdf#page=6|page 164]]

> The data obtained from the study were analyzed from the perspective of student learning styles and cultures. The findings of this study fall into six main categories. [[Resources/Articles/2011 Bista - Academic Dishonesty Among International Students in Higher Education.pdf#page=7|page 165]]

I like this kind of work. I need to figure out if I want to be a data analyst, a researcher, or a practitioner.

The way I'm thinking of it; a data analyst uses data that already exists and has a wide range of fields they can cover at a surface level. Researchers can go deeper into a more specific field and also generate new data with studies and experiments. A practitioner is also a researcher, but also an instructor.

I know I don't want to keep teaching ESL. Being a research analyst sounds like what I want; either that or a PhD/EdD and get into teacher education or leadership. So the better question is what would be the difference between a research analyst and a researcher/PhD haver?

> In a response to a question regarding previous learning and exam preparation in their home country, 93.3 percent of international students admitted that they primarily memorized informa- tion, 43.3 percent acknowledged use of group study, 50 percent were encouraged to prepare by rote learning, and 10 percent experienced col- laborative testing and sharing answers for exams.
> 
> In response to a question on writing and information-finding conventions, 76.7 percent of respondents admitted that they did not follow the American Psychological Association or Modern Library Association writing format on class assignments in their previous work at their home university. This indicates that the majority of survey participants followed standard writing formats only in American schools. Similarly, 16.7 percent agreed that it was acceptable to consult with a friend when writing or studying, 26.7 percent believed that finding answers from online sources was acceptable, and 30 percent shared that getting help from others in taking an online exam or completing a take-home test was appropriate. [[Resources/Articles/2011 Bista - Academic Dishonesty Among International Students in Higher Education.pdf#page=7|page 165--166]]

How can their culture be leveraged to improve learning and retention?
Maybe by having them do things for their community? Like, taking turns being the "translator" or taking turns being the one helping others study for the test?

> These responses suggest that many international students were pursuing university study without a particular interest in the academic field. [[Resources/Articles/2011 Bista - Academic Dishonesty Among International Students in Higher Education.pdf#page=8|page 166]]

[[International students often choose majors that they are not interested in]]

> For most international students, face-to-face encounters with native English speakers did not occur until their entry into the United States. As a result, many students cannot express themselves comfortably, have low self-esteem, and fear making mistakes when they approach their professors in an American classroom setting (Cammish, 1997). [[Resources/Articles/2011 Bista - Academic Dishonesty Among International Students in Higher Education.pdf#page=8|page 166]]

[[Living in the United States is the first time many international students have used English outside of a foreign language classroom]]

> This conflict of classroom culture is supported by student responses to the question about student-teacher interaction. Students indicated that their home country behavior practices still influenced their U.S. classroom interactions. Seventy percent responded, "I listen more and speak less"; 40 percent said, "To be silent is a part of a good discipline in the class"; and 13.3 percent responded, "There were no questions and interaction in the class," and, "I never made eye-to-eye contact while speaking." This indicates that international students in this study bear similar cultural features to those in previous studies. [[Resources/Articles/2011 Bista - Academic Dishonesty Among International Students in Higher Education.pdf#page=9|page 167]]

I could see this in my students in China. But, I could also see that many students were frustrated with this and knew that it was not a good way to learn. Even with my students in the U.S. from DR Congo; I often hear comments like "good pedagogy" from active learning and project-based work proposals.

> When a professor asks a question in class, international students some- times take longer to collect their thoughts or formulate an answer. Beginning instructors may not be aware that some foreign students are mentally translating words before speaking. When possible, international students like to use "beautiful sentences" from books or other resources to include in their writing to compensate for these language difficulties. [[Resources/Articles/2011 Bista - Academic Dishonesty Among International Students in Higher Education.pdf#page=10|page 168]]

This could be related to [[How does language proficiency influence learning;]].

> it is essential that educators teaching international students understand the social, cultural, and pedagogical background of their students and how they mayor may not be aligned with U.S. academic values and behaviors (Grey, 2002). [[Resources/Articles/2011 Bista - Academic Dishonesty Among International Students in Higher Education.pdf#page=11|page 169]]

[[It is important for faculty to understand the cultural backgrounds of their students and how it affects their academic life]] ^0fcfbf

> One possible solution is to offer an integrated bridge course on academic writing techniques and pitfalls for international students. Felix and Lawson (1994) and Bamford and Sergiou (2005) recommend conducting cultural reorientation programs focused on proper reference citation for international students. Ryan (2000, p. 56) makes these suggestions for reducing plagiarism among international students: 
> 
> - Discuss what plagiarism is, and give examples.
> - Explain the difference between paraphrasing and plagiarism.
> - Demonstrate to students how to paraphrase, synthesize, and weave other sources into their own work.
> - Show students how they are supposed to meet referencing requirement and why the requirements exist.
> - State what is not permitted, describing what it is and why it is unacceptable.
> - Explicitly state the consequences of not complying with the rules against plagiarism. 
>

> Arkoudis (2007) recommends that all teachers of students who are not native English speakers use a variety of educational approaches to avoid plagiarism. [[Resources/Articles/2011 Bista - Academic Dishonesty Among International Students in Higher Education.pdf#page=11|page 169]]

[[Use a variety of teaching techniques to accommodate diverse cultural backgrounds]]
This means I could experiment with using rote memorization, lecture, call and response and other oral techniques to help drive fluency.

> It is difficult to break the routine habits of international students (Bamford & Sergious, 2005), and they must receive direct, explicit instruction concerning plagiarism in the preparation of research papers as well as course work. It is important for faculty to understand the divergent linguistic and cultural backgrounds of their international students.

Break is an interesting word choice. Success in conventional classrooms is synonymous with adopting a white racial habitus but also "breaking" their native culture.
