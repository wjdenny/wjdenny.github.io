## Further Reading
> "One of the barriers to allyship," [Gassam Asare] explained, "is a lack of compassionate listening. Sometimes aspiring 'allies' want to relate so badly to someone's experience even when it's an experience they know nothing about." [page 2]

> Oluo explained that white people's attempts to "relate" often ended up invalidating the harm that racially marginalized people experience. [page 2--3]

[[Practice compassionate listening to avoid invalidating the experiences of others.]]

> " [...] To compare an individual experience of being treated differently to a structural issue that systemically harms a group of people is not a fair comparison." [page 3]

> The same way that trying to relate to someone who is grieving feels like a diminishment of invalidation of their feelings, when white people try to relate their unrelated experiences to the harm and terror that racially marginalized people experience, it causes further harm. It makes the person who opened up about their experience feel unheard. [page 3]

It also destroys any trust that person had in you. One key thing I can use to remember this while practicing compassionate listening is to remember: it's not about me. It's not about my experience. It's not about what I think about that person's experience.

> "whiteness always seeks to center itself." [page 4]

This might be true of all people, or at least people who are in a dominant group within a society. The Han ethnic group in China seems to center itself quite often within Chinese society, for example. Perhaps it could be further said that *power always seeks to center itself.*

> I would now define white-centering as
> 
> > action and behaviors that prioritize, uplift, amplify, and venerate white people and the dominant white culture above other cultures and communities.
> 
>  [page 4--5]

> White supremacy, according to *Merriam-Webster* Online, is "the belief that the white race is inherently superior to other races and that white people should have control over people of other races." as well as "the social, economic, and political systems that collectively enable white people to maintain power over people of other races."[^3] It is important to note that anyone, regardless of their racial background, can center whiteness [but b]ased on these definitions, non-white people cannot be white supremacists in a society where they do not hold the power. #topic/white-supremacy

[[White supremacy and white-centering are similar but distinct concepts.]]

> White supremacy culture discourages imagination, encourages perfectionism, and a scarcity mindset[^1], and is also harmful to the environment[^2]-- issues that affect us all.  [page 5--6] #topic/white-supremacy 

In this description, #topic/white-supremacy seems almost indistinguishable from #topic/capitalism .

> White-centering can be thought of as one result of white supremacy culture, but anyone can center whiteness because whiteness is not a person but a system. [page 6] #topic/culture/habitus #topic/white-supremacy 

^47e6aa

[[Being white is not the same as having a white racial habitus.]]

> Equity will never be a reality while whiteness is being centered in our workplaces. [page 6]
