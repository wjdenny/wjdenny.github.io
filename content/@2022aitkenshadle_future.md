# The [[Future Promise initiative]]: An Action Research Study of a Community College's Integrated Program Serving Immigrant Students

- [[Gisella M. Aitken-Shadle]] wrote this dissertation for the [[University of Dayton]] in [[Dayton]], [[Ohio]].

> [!summary] Summary
> Aitken-Shadle's dissertation studied the results of a bridge program to better support linguistic minority students at a community college. The program combines community outreach with counseling and academic support. Factors that support or challenge linguistic minority students' success in higher education are also discussed.

## Notes
### Chapter One: Problem of Practice
#### Statement of the problem
> **This dissertation is an action research study assessing the [[Future Promise initiative]], an intentional effort by [[Northeastern Iowa Community College|NICC]] to improve the recruitment, retention, and academic performance of immigrant students begun in 2021.**

> the funds of knowledge and literacy ecology theoretical frameworks, which emphasize the importance of drawing on students' practical knowledge in creating a curriculum and learning environment.

> creating a bridge program integrating ESOL instruction into [[Northeastern Iowa Community College|NICC]]'s credit-based programs and developing professional trainings for faculty and staff to help them better adapt student services to help address those challenges. The quantitative data showed that initiatives such as more intentional outreach into the immigrant community dramatically increased student attendance but had only a slight positive impact on the rate of improvement in English-language proficiency.

> intentional outreach to underserved student populations can be effective, and that engaging organizational stakeholders, including students, is a powerful means of bringing about organizational change. 

These are possible directions for future research.

> improving student services for underserved student populations will often require a broader change in the organizational culture. ^953eac

> The implementation of these initiatives also raises the possibility of studies comparing these efforts to those at other community colleges aimed at similar goals.

> IELCE -> Integrated English Literacy and Civics Education
> SMST -> [[Success Model]] Student Tracking

The organization of a Ed. D dissertation, or action research study, seems to start with a statement of the problem; seems more like technical writing.

> Community colleges in the United States have long been recognized for playing an important role in meeting the educational needs of immigrant students because they are affordable, offer English language instruction, provide vocational training, and provide a pathway to four-year colleges and universities ([[1994 Tichenor|Tichenor, 1994]]; [[2013 Kim & Díaz|Kim & Díaz, 2013]]). **[[The Migration Policy Institute]] ([[2020 Migration Policy Institute|2020]]) estimates that the number of immigrant origin students (that is, students who are first generation immigrants or the children of immigrants) enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities increased from 2.9 million in 2000 to 5.3 million in 2018, and as a percent of the total student population increased from 20 percent in 2000 to 28 percent in 2018.** Although recent data on nationwide immigrant origin student enrollment in community colleges is lacking, **the growth in the nationwide immigrant student population and data showing that over half of foreign-born Hispanic and Asian undergraduates enroll in community colleges ([[2012 Department of Education|Department of Education, 2012]]) suggest that the percent of community college students who are immigrants is likely higher than the 25 percent recorded in 2003-04 ([[2006 Department of Education|Department of Education, 2006]]).** ^cb9338

> Some immigrant students who seek to enroll in community colleges' certificate and diploma programs lack the needed English language proficiency, and therefore must transition from ESOL or developmental ("remedial") education programs into for-credit programs. In some cases, however, **this assessment, placement, and transition process could be better designed and better serve the needs of diverse immigrant student populations ([[2003 Harklau|Harklau, 2003]])** [page 11--12]

> [[Northeastern Iowa Community College|NICC]] implements the [[Future Promise initiative]], a new effort aimed at the recruitment of immigrant students and the integration of English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) and adult basic education instruction with the college's certificate, diploma, and degree programs. [page 12]

> [[Future Promise initiative|The initiative]] initially focused on developing more intentional recruitment of immigrant students, focusing on high schools and local business partners, extending the college's effective [[Success Model]] of student recruitment and retention. It has grown to include **integrating English-language instruction into the college's CPC and associate degree programs while providing additional forms of academic support.** [page 13]

> **In the [[Success Model]], "success coaches" engage with prospective students, informing them about [[Northeastern Iowa Community College|NICC]]'s academic programming, but also helping students overcome obstacles that prospective students may face to enrolling in the college or completing their education.** Once students are admitted to [[Northeastern Iowa Community College|NICC]] , success coaches help students enroll, connect them with the staff members who provide testing services, and act as advisors as students face challenges in achieving their academic goals. As part of the [[Future Promise initiative]], a success coach was hired to work among the immigrant community, connect with local employers and  local high school staff, and identify prospective immigrant students who could benefit from the initiative. Success coaches will also help students identify their educational and career goals and help students enroll in the programs most relevant for those goals. [page 13--14]

The [[Success Model]] sounds interesting, and might be similar to the academic bridge programs like those at [[Miami University]].

> Students already in the workforce recruited into the initiative will be assessed using the [[Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment Systems]] (CASAS) exam, focusing on mathematics and English language proficiency in reading and listening. Students scoring at levels of proficiency below that needed to succeed in college will be offered ESOL instruction. if students lack a high school diploma, they will also be enrolled in the HSED program. Students will also work toward the goal of enrolling in for credit programs, or alternatively, will concurrently enroll in a CPC program. Students with higher levels of English proficiency will be enrolled in a Transitions class focused on preparing them for college-level English work. Students who complete the HSED program or who have a high school diploma and who achieve adequate English proficiency will also have the option of enrolling in the Integrated English Literacy and Civics Education (IELCE) program, in which students enroll in a diploma or degree program at [[Northeastern Iowa Community College|NICC]] while concurrently receiving ESOL instruction, support in academic content areas, and civics education (which includes United States history and government, and preparation for naturalization, if possible). [page 14]

What if they don't need or want the support? It seems like lower levels have the option, but higher levels are required to take Transitions?

Maybe we could develop something similar, like an immigrant-origin section of College 101; or more general HSC-160.

> "We listen identify and respond to the needs and expectations of our internal and external communities" ([[Northeast Iowa Community College]], n.d.a). The initiative grows out of the recognition by the college's staff that the college could improve its efforts to meet the needs of a particular student population, immigrant students. [[Northeastern Iowa Community College|NICC]] also identifies Innovation as one of its core values: "We foster the development and advancement of ideas through individual and team creativity" ([[Northeast Iowa Community College]], n. d. a). The [[Future Promise initiative]] is an example of the sort of creativity envisioned by this statement, designed to better meet the needs of students and the broader community. Similarly, the college promotes the value of Resiliency: "We learn from our experiences, refocus and seize the opportunity to improve and persist" ([[Northeast Iowa Community College]], n. d. a). This statement is consistent with the action research approach, which is a systematic effort to learn from initiatives in the classroom with the goal of constantly improving practice. The initiative also furthers the BCS division's more practical goals focused on developing partnerships with local businesses and institutions to promote community vitality. Business leaders in Iowa have recognized the valuable contribution immigrants can make to the state's economy ([[2019 Byers et al.|Byers et al., 2019]]) and by enhancing the academic and vocational skills of immigrant students, the [[Future Promise initiative]] helps meet the workforce needs of the state. [page 15]

This would be a perfect fit for the [[Innovation Grant]]. I like how the author is tying all of this to the college's mission and vision statements.

> My goal for this dissertation in practice is to create an embedded evaluation process ([[2021 Giancola|Giancola, 2021]]) to assess the initiative and improve it going forward. [page 16]


> Community colleges in the [[United States]] are an attractive path to educational and career success for immigrants ([[1994 Tichenor|Tichenor, 1994]]; [[@2011teranishi_immigrants|Teranishi et al., 2011]]), and the role played by community colleges as pathways to success will only grow in importance as the number of immigrants in the [[United States]] continues to increase, both in terms of raw numbers and as a percent of the total population ([[2020 Budiman|Budiman, 2020]]). Recognizing the important role they play in meeting the needs of immigrant students, community colleges have become more conscientious about attempting to meet the needs of this growing population, but much work remains to be done ([[@2011teranishi_immigrants|Teranishi et al., 2011]]). One reason this work remains ongoing is because immigrant students are not a homogenous group; rather, they are incredibly diverse, representing a variety of national and ethnic backgrounds, levels of English-language proficiency, cultural values, and educational and career goals ([[2002 Szelényi & Chang|Szelényi & Chang, 2002]]). [[Resources/Articles/2022 Aitken-Shadle.pdf#page=NaN|page 16]]

> One group of immigrant students particularly important for community colleges are those identified as **"U.S.-educated language minority students" ([[2011 Bunch et al.|Bunch et al., 2011]]) or "Generation 1.5" ([[2002 Blumenthal|Blumenthal, 2002]]).** These are immigrant students who immigrated to the United States as pre-teens or teens, receiving part of their education in their country of birth and part in the United States ([[2002 Blumenthal|Blumenthal, 2002]]). U.S.-educated language minority students face educational and social challenges distinct from immigrants who arrived in the United States as adults or as young children. **Community colleges, however, are often ill-equipped to meet the needs of these students, and therefore creative efforts to do so are needed ([[2002 Blumenthal|Blumenthal, 2002]]; [[2019 Witenstein & Niese|Witenstein & Niese, 2019]]) while also meeting the needs of adult immigrant students.** [page 16--17] 

> As the immigrant population of Iowa has increased, [[Northeastern Iowa Community College|NICC]] has enrolled a growing number of immigrant students. **The foreign-born population in Iowa has grown from 3.1 percent of the total population in 2000 to 5.6 percent of the total in 2019, and has increased by 95.2 percent in total numbers. The largest group of foreign-born residents in Iowa are those from Asia, making up 35.1 percent of the foreign-born, including immigrants from China, India, and Vietnam, among other countries, and immigrants from Latin America and the Caribbean make up 33.9 percent of the foreign-born population, most notably immigrants from Mexico and Central America** ([[Migration Policy Institute]], n.d.). Despite the increasing number of immigrants in the population served by the college, [[Northeastern Iowa Community College|NICC]], like many other institutions of higher education, does not have precise information on immigrant student enrollment. **Higher education institutions face challenges in tracking the enrollment of immigrant students because of the difficult question of whether to classify naturalized citizens (i.e., individuals who immigrated to the [[United States]] but have become citizens), international students, and students on temporary work visas (which the U.S. government classifies as "nonimmigrant" visas) as “immigrants,” concerns about student privacy, and ethical considerations regarding tracking the status of undocumented students ([[2002 Szelényi & Chang|Szelényi & Chang, 2002]])**  [page 17]

Categorization is an issue; cf Nursing department using "international student" so broadly.
This could be a piece of the [[Data Analysis Project]].

> **Nationwide, immigrant students enrolled in AEL programs tend to be adults over the age of 25 who are seeking greater English-language proficiency or a high school equivalency diploma to improve their career prospects and better provide for their families** ([[2002 Blumenthal|Blumenthal, 2002]]). [page 18]

> many of these students do not have the English-language proficiency needed to fully thrive in a higher education environment. In addition, **when students lack English-language proficiency in high school, it can contribute to lower proficiency in other areas such as math, science, and social studies ([[1987 Collier|Collier, 1987]]; [[2016 Yoder et al.|Yoder et al., 2016]]), leaving students underprepared for college** [page 18] ^f32aa8

[[Students who struggle with understanding English in high school often will end up struggling in other subjects as well.]]

> As with many community colleges ([[2002 Blumenthal|Blumenthal, 2002]]; [[2019 Raufman et al.|Raufman et al., 2019]]), [[Northeastern Iowa Community College|NICC]]'s ESOL program is "housed" in its non-credit adult education division. Students enrolled in for-credit degree and certificate programs who struggle with English language proficiency have few resources available to them. [page 18--19]

How many credits are we covering this semester? how would that compare to a hypothetical bridge or support program like that in [[Miami University]]?

> Although the college offers educational and career programs that attract immigrant students, the college had so far not been intentional about recruiting immigrant students, identifying their distinctive challenges, or designing programs to meet their needs. The [[Future Promise initiative]] is a substantial effort to focus recruitment on prospective immigrant students and design programming to meet their distinctive needs. [page 19]

> By integrating the college's AEL programs with its for-credit programs, the [[Future Promise initiative]] provides immigrant students the support they need to meet their academic goals. [page 19]

> In recent years, a great deal of research has been done on the transition of immigrant students from ESOL programming to credit-based certificate and degree programs at community colleges. These studies have often been qualitative, focusing on the experiences of immigrant students and drawing on these experiences to make recommendations on how community colleges can better serve students during this transition process, or analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of how diverse community colleges manage this transition process ([[2010 Hansen|Hansen, 2010]]; [[2014 Darbes|Darbes, 2014]]; [[2017 Suh|Suh, 2017]]; [[2018 Stribling|Stribling, 2018]]; [[2010 Safran & Visher|Safran & Visher, 2010]]). The present study fills a gap in the research because rather than analyzing already-existing institutional efforts, it involves the development, analysis, and assessment of a new initiative aimed at helping immigrant students transition to a community college’s credit-based programs. [page 19--20]

> This study will be guided by the [[Literacy Ecology Framework|literacy ecology theoretical framework]] for understanding language and literacy proficiency among adults. Building on the [[Funds of Knowledge Theory]] that proposes that students draw on funds of knowledge from their family and social context as they learn ([[1992 Moll et al.|Moll et al., 1992]]), the [[Literacy Ecology Framework]] claims that literacy is a social practice learned in everyday contexts and that language and literacy instruction should build on this everyday practice of literacy ([[2014 Chao & Mantero|Chao & Mantero, 2014]]). The study will adopt an [[action research methodology]] in which data are gathered and analyzed to improve practice ([[2009 Pine|Pine, 2009]]). The study will also involve mixed methods, in that quantitative data regarding student attendance and testing will be collected, as well as qualitative data drawn from interviews of students and instructors involved with the [[Future Promise initiative]]  [page 20--21]

> For example, U.S.-educated language minority students and adult immigrant students have quite different educational needs, but the population size of these diverse sub-populations will not be large enough to adequately study how they each experience the [[Future Promise initiative]]. [page 22]

[[Not all linguistic minority students are the same]]

> the student population involved in the study will represent the immigrant population in the northeast [[Iowa]] region, which may not be representative of immigrant student populations in other regions of the [[United States]]. [page 22]

How different are the immigrant populations in other states?
[[Overview of immigrant populations in the U.S.]]

#### Review of Relevant Literature
> [[Funds of Knowledge Theory|The funds of knowledge theory]] was developed by K-12 educators in [[Arizona]] working with students of Mexican origin, many of them immigrants ([[1992 Vélez-Ibáñez & Greenberg|Vélez-Ibáñez & Greenberg, 1992]]). **The theory was meant to counter "deficit thinking" in education, the notion that underachievement in school reflected deeper underlying deficiencies rooted in a student's race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, immigration status, etc.** ([[2005 González et al.|González et al., 2005]]). Instead, [[Funds of Knowledge Theory]] recognizes that students' families possess "historically-accumulated and culturally-developed bodies of knowledge and skills essential for household or individual functioning and well-being" ([[1992 Moll et al.|Moll et al., 1992]], p. 133). Educators must uncover these funds of knowledge, in particular by visiting students' families, and draw upon them to create a more inclusive classroom and to promote student learning ([[2018 Llopart & Esteban-Guitart|Llopart & Esteban-Guitart, 2018]]). Although originally developed in a K-12 setting, the [[Funds of Knowledge Theory]] has been applied to adult learners, particularly in the field of literacy ([[2012 Larrotta & Serrano|Larrotta & Serrano, 2012]]; [[2012 Mosley & Zoch|Mosley & Zoch, 2012]]; [[2019 Cun et al.|Cun et al., 2019]]). Notably, for adult learners, funds of knowledge are re-defined as "an array of life experiences, skills and talents, language proficiencies, and learning experiences" that adult students bring with them to the classroom ([[2012 Larrotta & Serrano|Larrotta & Serrano, 2012]], p. 316).The [[Funds of Knowledge Theory|funds of knowledge approach]] has also more recently been applied in [[higher education]] settings, including community colleges ([[2017 Colina Neri|Colina Neri, 2017]]; [[2017 George Mwangi|George Mwangi, 2017]]; [[2017 Marquez Kiyama|Marquez Kiyama, 2017]]; [[2017 Mora & Rios-Aguilar|Mora & Rios-Aguilar, 2017]]) [page 22--23] ^88b036

> [[Literacy Ecology Framework|The literacy ecology approach]] to adult education builds on the [[Funds of Knowledge Theory]] by recognizing the important role that adult learners’ social context plays in literacy education ([[2014 Chao & Mantero|Chao & Mantero, 2014]]). The literacy ecology approach draws on the idea that literacy is a social practice that that takes place in everyday contexts such as the family and workplace; literacy emerges as adult learners confront the problems that arise in these everyday situations ([[1989 Auerbach|Auerbach, 1989]]; [[2003 Hornberger|Hornberger, 2003]]; [[2007 Barton|Barton, 2007]]). [[Literacy Ecology Framework|The literacy ecology approach]] proposes that adult learners draw on the knowledge and skills they use in everyday situations to collaborate with instructors and peers to acquire literacy, a process that also involves emancipation from social limitations ([[2003 Hornberger|Hornberger, 2003]]; [[2004 van Lier|van Lier, 2004]]; [[2007 Barton|Barton, 2007]]; [[2007 Norton|Norton, 2007]]; [[2010 Janks|Janks, 2010]]; [[2014 Chao & Mantero|Chao & Mantero, 2014]]). [page 23--24]

similar to [[Paolo Freire]]?
[[The literacy ecology framework supposes that literacy is acquired when people use language to handle problems in their daily lives]]

> Although the [[Funds of Knowledge Theory|funds of knowledge]] and [[literacy ecology|literacy ecology]] theories typically emphasize how students draw on their knowledge and skills from everyday life in the classroom, this study will take an innovative approach by focusing on the capacity of students to draw on this knowledge while offering input on how [[Northeastern Iowa Community College|NICC]] can better meet their educational and career needs. [page 24]

> Drawing on the [[Funds of Knowledge Theory|funds of knowledge approach]], the initiative will draw on students' life experiences and proficiencies as [[Asset-focused Mindset|assets]] for furthering their education while also helping students address obstacles or barriers to their education [page 24]

>  The [[Future Promise initiative]] seeks to integrate English-language learning with the college's career-oriented programs and academic programs, meaning that English-language acquisition will be linked to students' educational and career aspirations. Thinking of English-language acquisition in this way recognizes the social context of literacy acquisition emphasized by the literacy ecology approach.  [page 24]

> Research on immigrant students at community colleges is a rapidly growing field ([[2020 Suh et al.|Suh et al., 2020]]; [[@2011teranishi_immigrants|Teranishi et al., 2011]]). **A substantial part of this research focuses on English-language learners and the process by which community colleges assess and place them**, although other research has focused on different questions related to the immigrant experience, such as cultural adaptation and challenges arising from students' legal status. This literature review will begin by surveying research on the experience of immigrant students at community colleges broadly considered, then focus on research specifically focused on English-language learners.  [page 25]

> [[2010 Conway|Conway's (2010) study]] of immigrant students at an urban community college found that immigrant students were more likely to aspire to transferring to a four-year institution to complete their bachelor's degree than their native-born peers, and less likely to transition from a transfer-focused program to a terminal program as they progressed through their classes. Undocumented students and [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]] (DACA) recipients, who face distinct challenges because of their precarious legal status and lack of access to in-state tuition in many cases, identify resiliency and the desire to succeed as important traits that contribute to their academic success ([[2017 Gámez et al.|Gámez et al., 2017]]). [page 25]

>  it is also important to recognize the emotional toll experienced by many students; immigrant students, especially undocumented students, can experience fear and anxiety about the potential detention or deportation of themselves or a family member, negatively impacting academic performance ([[2019 Witenstein et al.|Witenstein et al., 2019]]). [page 25--26]

[[The anxiety surrounding immigration issues can put unusual pressures on immigrant students]] This affects their academic work, as we know that [[People acquire language better when their affective filters are not interfering]]

> Immigrant students identify mentors as an important support contributing to academic success, whether these mentors act in a formal capacity, or more frequently, act as informal guides through the higher education experience ([[2013 Janis|Janis, 2013]]; [[2017 Gámez et al.|Gámez et al., 2017]]). [page 26]

[[Mentors are documented as vital support for immigrant students as they move through higher education]]

> [[2019 Hernandez et al.|Hernandez et al. (2019)]] found that immigrant students who reported more family responsibilities tended to spend more time on campus, most likely because they would not be able to complete schoolwork while at home; as a result, many of these students showed improved academic performance, particularly if their time on campus was used productively [page 26]

> Both immigrant students and community college staff must navigate a patchwork of often changing national and state-level policies regarding tuition, financial aid, and student services ([[2010 Oseguera et al.|Oseguera et al., 2010]]; [[2019 Suárez-Orozco, et al.|Suárez-Orozco, et al., 2019]]; [[2019 Witenstein & Niese|Witenstein & Niese, 2019]]). Community college staff often lack appropriate training in these policies and are not prepared to meet the specific needs of immigrant students, including undocumented students ([[2010 Oseguera et al.|Oseguera et al., 2010]]). [page 27]

> a surprising number of institutions of higher education, including community colleges, do not adequately identify and track immigrant students, in part because of the difficulty in precisely who counts as an "immigrant" and in part because of privacy concerns for students, particularly undocumented students ([[2002 Szelényi & Chang|Szelényi and Chang, 2002]]).  [page 27]

I wonder if there are ways to do this with existing [[Institutional Research]] data. What would we need? for the [[Data Analysis Project]]

>  take steps to learn about and communicate to students about national and state policies affecting immigrant students; recognize how these policies impact student services and re-design student services to better meet the needs of immigrant students; and develop partnerships with local non-profits to provide needed support to immigrant students ([[2019 Teranishi, et al.|Teranishi, et al., 2019]]; [[2019 Witenstein et al.|Witenstein et al., 2019]]). [page 27]

> [[2019 Park|Park (2019)]] found that international students progressed through community college ESOL programs more rapidly than U.S.-educated language minority students, suggesting that students who have received formal reading, writing, and grammar instruction in their own language fare better in ESOL classes than students whose language instruction was interrupted, or that ESOL course curricula are geared toward the former. [page 28]

^d33ef3

[[People who have had formal education in their first language learn a second language faster than those without.]]

Maybe [[Global Learning]] records of high school transcripts and other university transcripts can be combined with other institutional data to distinguish international students from other ESOL students? for the [[Data Analysis Project]]

> ESOL students may include those with limited literacy in their native language, those with relatively high literacy skills in their native language, and native English speakers who speak another dialect or variety of English and need instruction in Standard American English ([[2004 Crandall & Sheppard|Crandall & Sheppard, 2004]]) [page 28]

> Researchers have focused on **distinguishing the experience and educational needs of adult immigrants on the one hand and U.S.-educated language minority students or "Generation 1.5" students, that is, students who immigrated to the United States as children, on the other** ([[2002 Blumenthal|Blumenthal, 2002]]; [[2011 Bunch et al.|Bunch et al., 2011]]). ESOL students also differ in their ultimate educational goals; some are primarily interested in English language instruction to improve their language proficiency in everyday situations, while others see ESOL as a pathway to further educational goals ([[2002 Blumenthal|Blumenthal, 2002]]) [page 28--29]

>  limited English proficiency can negatively impact student success in other content areas, even areas in which they may be proficient in their native language ([[1987 Collier|Collier, 1987]]; [[2016 Yoder et al.|Yoder et al., 2016]]). This is borne out by [[2009 Conway|Conway's (2009)]] study showing that immigrant students who attended ESOL classes in American high schools (i.e., U.S.-educated language minority students) are less successful in community college than immigrant students who completed high school in their native country.  [page 29]

[[Students who struggle with understanding English in high school often will end up struggling in other subjects as well.]]

> [[2011 Becker|Becker (2011)]] linked educational attainment in immigrants' home countries with other forms of "cultural capital" such as socioeconomic status and prestige as determinants leading to success in transitioning from ESOL instruction to credit courses at community colleges. [page 29]

^9e547e

[[Social and economic capital can provide advantages to students in higher education.]]

> [[2016 Fong et al.|Fong et al. (2016)]] also found that among Hispanic students, those with limited English proficiency had significantly greater retention than their peers, a fact possibly attributed to the support students experience as a result of the camaraderie among non-English speaking students, or the motivational traits often characteristic of immigrant students, noted above. By nurturing a distinct cohort of immigrant students, the Future Promise initiative could potentially create this same spirit of camaraderie. [page 29--30]

[[Intentional cohorts of immigrant students can support each other through the difficult road of higher education]]

> ESOL programs inhabit different "locations" within community colleges. For example, ESOL programs can be included as part of the college's for-credit curriculum, where they may be included as part of the college's developmental (or "remedial") education program, or housed under the college's English or foreign language departments. Alternatively, ESOL programs can offer non-credit classes and may be stand-alone programs or be housed in the college's adult education program. Some community colleges offer both forms of ESOL instruction ([[2002 Blumenthal|Blumenthal, 2002]]; [[2019 Raufman et al.|Raufman et al., 2019]]).  [page 30]

We use both for-credit and non-credit ESOL programs, as well as ESOL support sections for some departments.

> in many cases the decision on where to "house" ESOL programs has as much to do with where funding for the program comes from as it does with educational purposes ([[2002 Blumenthal|Blumenthal, 2002]]).  [page 30]

> Community college ESOL programs have also developed a number of types of partnerships to better meet the needs of students and the broader community. For example, in some instances, non-profit organizations offer basic and intermediate ESOL instruction (often for free) while a community college offers advanced ESOL instruction in for-credit courses ([[2004 Crandall & Sheppard|Crandall & Sheppard, 2004]]). Some community colleges offer onsite English language instruction for businesses seeking training for their employees, or businesses provide funding for ESOL instruction on campus where the curriculum is designed to be relevant to employees of the business needing English-language instruction ([[2013 ESL speaks the language of business|ESL speaks the language of business, 2013]]). [page 31]


> The amount of funding is also often based on political considerations rather than the educational needs of students and the organizational needs of colleges ([[2002 Blumenthal|Blumenthal, 2002]]; [[2004 Crandall & Sheppard|Crandall & Sheppard, 2004]]). [page 31--32]

> Funding limitations can also make it difficult to recruit quality ESOL instructors because of the low salaries, and instructors often leave after a short time in search of employment with higher salaries. Aside from financial considerations, ESOL instructors at community colleges often have less prestige or institutional status than instructors in other areas ([[2002 Blumenthal|Blumenthal, 2002]]).  [page 32]

As I've said.. we're the adjuncts of adjuncts.

>  Some ESOL programs lack robust connections with other community college programs, which can lead to neglect when it comes to funding and underrepresentation in institutional governance. In other cases, a community college may have a number of English-language instruction programs scattered across the college, such as ESOL courses for adult immigrants, developmental education courses for credit-seeking students, and for-credit courses for international students, that lack coordination and shared leadership ([[2004 Crandall & Sheppard|Crandall & Sheppard, 2004]]). **Crandall and Sheppard (2004) argue that ESOL programs are most effective when they are centralized, that is, the various types of English-language instruction are directed from the same office, and they share several links with other programs at the college.** [page 32]

I think this was part of the reasoning behind the creation of [[Global Learning]].
[[Researchers argue that a centralized ESOL program is more effective than several uncoordinated programs]]

> [[2013 Rodriguez|Rodriguez (2013)]] compared students who completed a typical community college ESOL program to those who completed an English language immersion program offered at the same college, finding that the two programs led to comparable outcomes in later English classes, but slightly different rates of retention and credit acquisition. [[2011 Bunch et al.|Bunch et al. (2011)]] found that students enrolled in developmental education courses often struggled with their credit coursework and gave up on their academic aspirations. This finding is supported by [[2012 Hodara|Hodara (2012)]], who found that students enrolled in ESOL and developmental education English classes had lower retention and credit acquisition after transitioning into for-credit courses than students who had been immediately placed in college writing; these outcomes were improved if students' English-language instruction included both reading and writing rather than focusing mostly on writing. The same study found that students in the ESOL program had lower retention and credit acquisition than students placed in the developmental education program ([[2012 Hodara|Hodara, 2012]]) [page 33]

[[ESOL students fare better when they are prepared for for-credit college courses, especially in terms of the reading demands involved]]

> **Assessment and placement processes must be designed to adequately address the distinctive needs of different student groups.** As [[2008 BUnch & Panayotova|Bunch and Panayotova (2008)]] argue, **different processes for assessing and placing English language learners reflect different theoretical understandings of bilingualism and English language acquisition, some more appropriate to the student populations being served than others**. For example, researchers have examined the challenges faced by adult immigrants transitioning from ESOL programs to developmental education (Suh, 2017) or credit courses (Stribling, 2018) and the ways in which adult immigrant students may not be served well by the transition process. U.S.-educated language minority students, or “Generation 1.5” students, have been researchers’ primary area of focus, however. For example, the needs of U.S.- educated language minority students are not met by ESOL courses designed for international students with proficiency in grammar and composition in their native language, or by classes designed for adult immigrant students with limited exposure to American culture and education ([[2003 Harklau|Harklau, 2003]]; [[2008 Di Genarro|Di Genarro, 2008]]). [page 33--34]

[[There should be different approaches to placing ESOL students because different groups of students will acquire language differently; it's not one-size-fits-all language support]]

> **U.S.-educated language minority students may be disadvantaged by the assessments used in the placement process**, as well. [[2008 Bunch & Panayotova|Bunch and Panayotova (2008)]] showed that many of these students possess **"circumstantial bilingualism," meaning that they develop proficiency in English in everyday situations where English is needed but may be less proficient in other settings.** English-proficiency assessment tests may create an artificial environment in which these students test poorly, not accurately capturing how students may demonstrate English-language proficiency in ways that would be relevant for their academic development ([[2008 Bunch & Panayotova|Bunch & Panayotova, 2008]]).  [page 34]

[[One can be proficient in a language for some situations but not others]]

> [[2014 Darbes|Darbes (2014)]] focuses on the experience of immigrant students as they are assessed and placed in different “tracks” (ESL, developmental or “remedial” education, and college English), exploring how students both take on and resist the identities that are given to them through the placement process. **For some immigrant students who had successfully completed ESL programs in high school, being placed in ESL again when they begin college can be demoralizing and marginalizing** ([[2011 Salas et al.|Salas et al., 2011]]). [page 34--35]

What are the tracks in our department?
afaik, we have ELA course sequence, ERS and Basic Writing developmental classes for mainstream, and Comp.

> [[2018 Stribling|Stribling (2018)]] focuses on the experiences of adult immigrant students who transitioned from ESL courses to for credit programs, particularly on students' resiliency and ability to negotiate and resist marginalization by others in order to academically succeed. [[2017 Suh|Suh's (2017) study]] of adult immigrant students focuses on the experience of transition from the community formed by fellow ESOL students to the college community, where students were often marginalized to an extent they did not expect based on their prior experience. [[2010 Hansen|Hansen (2010)]] traces the experience of Mexican immigrant students enrolled in developmental education courses at a community college, focusing on experiences of adaptation to American culture and college culture, and experiences of stigmatization as English-language learners. All of these studies raise issues about appropriate assessment, curriculum design, and transition from ESOL to academic programs that need to be considered in the design and implementation of the Future Promise initiative. [page 35]

[[Adult immigrant students are often marginalized in higher education after transitioning out of ESOL support courses.]] ([[2018 Stribling]], [[2017 Suh]], [[2010 Hansen]])

> [[2010 Safran & Visher|Safran and Visher (2010)]] provide case studies of how diverse community colleges manage the transition from ESL classes to credit classes. The case studies reveal a number of challenges faced by community colleges in meeting the needs of students. First, there is not a shared standard among community colleges concerning how students should be placed in different English-language instruction tracks and when a student is ready to transition from one track to another. This can lead to confusion and questions of equity as students with similar levels of proficiency are treated differently by different colleges. [page 35--36]

- [[Community colleges in the U.S. lack a standard way of evaluating English language proficiency.]] ([[2010 Safran & Visher]])

> Second, the high-stakes environment of placement testing may lead to test results that do not accurately reflect students' English-language proficiency. This can lead to students being misplaced in a track below their true proficiency level. 

- Common English language placement testing methods cause affective interference which reduces the validity and accuracy of the evaluation. ([[2010 Safran & Visher]])

> Third, ESL course curricula are sometimes not aligned with the content of placement tests. This means that even when ESL programs are successfully fostering English-language proficiency, they may not be adequately preparing students for the placement test that will determine their academic path. It also means that placement tests may not be accurately assessing students' progress in language proficiency acquisition ([[2010 Safran & Visher|Safran & Visher, 2010]]). [page 36]

- Misalignment between English language placement testing and ESL support programs is a barrier to education. ([[2010 Safran & Visher]])
- Misalignment between English language placement testing and ESL support programs is a missed opportunity to engage in on-going program evaluation. ([[2010 Safran & Visher]])

> This research study is meant to assess one such effort, the Future Promise initiative, by examining how the initiative builds on students' assets and assists them in achieving their educational and career goals while helping them overcome barriers to their education. [page 37]

- [[@2022aitkenshadle_future|Aitken-Shadle's 2022]] study looks at how a program initiative centers students' assets and removes barriers to education.

> This research study draws on the action research framework of educational research focused on learning through practice. Social psychologist [[Kurt Lewin]] coined the term "action research" to refer to a "spiral" process by which organizations plan their activity, carry out the plan, and systematically study their activities in order to improve their operations ([[1946 Lewin|Lewin, 1946]]). Action research has since become an influential approach to performing research in the educational field ([[2009 Pine|Pine, 2009]]; [[2018 Mills|Mills, 2018]]; [[2020 Mertler|Mertler, 2020]]). [page 37]

- [[Kurt Lewin]], a social psychologist, developed the concept of *action research* as a recursive process by which institutions plan, execute, and study their own improvement projects. ([[1946 Lewin]])

> The "spiral" process of investigation developed by [[Kurt Lewin|Lewin]] reflects a recursive understanding of research. Although action research begins with a distinct research problem, new questions emerge as the research progresses. As educators analyze the results of their actions, they raise new questions and generate new strategies for answering them. In action research, therefore, knowledge is always tentative and subject to revision in light of practice and analysis ([[2019 Creswell & Guetterman|Creswell & Guetterman, 2019]]). In action research, the researcher is involved in the educational practice being studied. This contrasts with a positivist approach to research, in which the researcher must remain an objective, neutral observer. Although the involvement of the researcher in the practice being studied raises the risk of bias, action research recognizes that the subjectivity of the researcher always plays a role in the research process ([[2009 Pine|Pine, 2009]]). Action research is also collaborative and participatory. Because the researcher is also engaged in educational practice, the research process involves collaboration with both colleagues and students. Action research often involves the collaboration of a team of educators ([[2020 Mertler|Mertler, 2020]]). [page 37--38]

- Positivist research methods position the researcher as a neutral observer, but action research understands that research is always subjective. ([[2009 Pine]])
- Action research, being collaborative and participatory, involves faculty, administration, and students working together. ([[2020 Mertler]])

> Scholars distinguish between practical action research, which is focused on addressing a particular problem experienced in an educational setting, and participatory action research, in which the subjects of the study are included as participants and the research is focused on social change ([[2018 Mills|Mills, 2018]]; [[2019 Creswell & Guetterman|Creswell & Guetterman, 2019]]; [[2020 Mertler|Mertler, 2020]]). Similarly, [[2012 Berg|Berg (2012)]] distinguishes three approaches to action research: technical/scientific/collaborative, which tests pedagogical interventions from within a positivist framework; practical/mutual collaborative/deliberative, in which educator/researchers work with other stakeholders to improve delivery; and emancipating/enhancing/critical science, which focuses on helping participants gain a clearer understanding of social barriers impacting students. Although the ultimate goal of this research is to promote the flourishing and emancipatory learning of immigrant students, consistent with the aims of action research ([[2009 Pine|Pine, 2009]]), the approach used in this study is best described as practical and collaborative because it is aimed at improving the delivery of adult education and literacy instruction to immigrant students through the collaboration of the researcher with college staff and students. As noted earlier, a key feature of the study is the participation of the students as collaborators in providing input into the future of the initiative. [page 38]

- Action research can be categorized further as practical action research and participatory action research ([[2018 Mills|Mills, 2018]]; [[2019 Creswell & Guetterman|Creswell & Guetterman, 2019]]; [[2020 Mertler|Mertler, 2020]])
	- Practical action research studies a particular problem in education. ([[2018 Mills|Mills, 2018]]; [[2019 Creswell & Guetterman|Creswell & Guetterman, 2019]]; [[2020 Mertler|Mertler, 2020]])
	- Participatory action research involve subjects as participants and is more heavily focused on social change. ([[2018 Mills|Mills, 2018]]; [[2019 Creswell & Guetterman|Creswell & Guetterman, 2019]]; [[2020 Mertler|Mertler, 2020]])
- [[2012 Berg]] makes a distinction between three approaches to action research.
	- A technical (also scientific or collaborative) approach to action research evaluates teaching interventions with a positivist lens. ([[2012 Berg]])
	- A practical (also mutual, collaborative, or deliberative) approach to action research brings stakeholders together to improve educational outcomes. ([[2012 Berg]])
	- A critical (also emancipating or enhancing) approach to action research helps subjects understand the social barriers that affect them. ([[2012 Berg]])

- Aitken-Shadle's 2022 action research study brings immigrant students into the initiative as both participants and collaborators. ([[@2022aitkenshadle_future]])

> this research study draws on the action research paradigm to study and bring about organizational transformation. Researchers have drawn on the action research approach to promote organizational change at community colleges through participatory planning, action, and study ([[2014 Purcell|Purcell, 2014]]). [page 39]

- The action research approach has been used to transform community colleges through a recursive process of action and study. ([[2014 Purcell]])

> All research and analysis involve a process of interpretation. This process works in two directions. On the one hand,the researcher must try to enter into the world experienced by the subjects of the research ([[2017 Hesse-Biber|Hesse-Biber, 2017]]). This is a process of discovery in which the researcher comes to understand the social reality of the subjects. On the other hand, the researcher is also part of social reality and brings to the table their own shared understandings and interpretations of the world that they have inherited from their own experience, a "lens" through which they see the world. [page 40]

- Because of the deeper involvement of researchers in action research studies, researchers must reflect on the biases they bring into the research. ([[2017 Hesse-Biber]])

> The sum total of the social and cultural factors that can influence how a researcher interprets their subject matter, such as gender, race, age, sexual orientation, immigration status, and personal experiences and beliefs, is sometimes referred to as the researcher's "position" or "positionality" ([[2007 Milner|Milner, 2007]]; [[2015 Berger|Berger, 2015]]). The characteristics and experiences that make up a researcher's positionality help shape the interests that guide his or her choice of research topic and offer a set of tools to interpret the experience of others ([[2013 Patnaik|Patnaik, 2013]]). It can also become a source of bias or misunderstanding. Researchers must, therefore, undergo a process of "reflexivity," which involves reflecting on their own positionality and potential biases and how this may impact their research ([[2013 Patnaik|Patnaik, 2013]]; [[2015 Berger|Berger, 2015]]). Reflexivity can also be "retrospective," meaning the researcher reflects on how they have changed and developed over the course of their research ([[2017 Attia & Edge|Attia & Edge, 2017]]). [page 40]

- The biases that researchers bring into their research as a result of social and cultural identities is referred to as a position or positionality. ([[2007 Milner|Milner, 2007]]; [[2015 Berger|Berger, 2015]])

I should write about my own position as a researcher and educator. Perhaps as part of a [[Projects/Job applications/Teaching Statement]], and this is also related to [[Implicit Bias]] in the classroom.

> Although there are no specific legal protections for immigrants and refugees as human research subjects, both groups should be treated as vulnerable populations ([[2019 Luna-Lucero|Luna-Lucero, 2019]]). Immigrants are often members of cultural or ethnic minorities who are at risk of discrimination or prejudice. The legal status of some immigrants in the United States on work visas may be dependent on the good will of their employers. Undocumented immigrants face the risk of deportation and also obstacles to employment and access to higher education. These and other considerations suggest that researchers should use practices that respect the persons and protect the confidentiality of immigrant and refugee participants. For one, to ensure that participants could provide informed consent, the informed consent form and all research materials presented to participants were carefully translated into the participants' native languages, or a language with which they are comfortable. In addition, research materials were presented in a way that takes into consideration the participants' education level ([[2019 Luna-Lucero|Luna-Lucero, 2019]]). Third, special efforts to preserve participants' confidentiality were made. These include: using methods for identifying potential research participants that will protect their identity; avoiding questions directly addressing participants' immigration status or immigration experiences; being especially diligent concerning data storage and transfer; and avoiding research methods such as focus groups in which participants might share confidential information with other participants whose discretion cannot be guaranteed ([[2019 Luna-Lucero|Luna-Lucero, 2019]]). [page 43--44]

- [[Immigrant and refugees should be considered vulnerable populations as research subjects because they are at a higher risk of discrimination and experience higher barriers to employment, education, and residency.]] ([[2019 Luna-Lucero]])
	- [[Efforts should be made to protect the confidentiality of immigrant and refugee research participants.]] ([[2019 Luna-Lucero]])
	- [[Informed consent and research materials for immigrant and refugee research participants should be provided in a comfortable language, dialect, and register.]] ([[2019 Luna-Lucero]])
	- [[Focus groups put sensitive information in the hands of other participants and so should be avoided when respecting confidentiality of vulnerable populations.]] ([[2019 Luna-Lucero]])

> One of the measures of success for the Future Promise initiative is whether there is an increase in the enrollment and retention of immigrant students in the college's ESOL program, and, as the program proceeds, in the college's HSED, CPC, and for-credit academic programs. [page 44]

[[@2022aitkenshadle_future|Aitken-Shadle's 2022 study]] compared enrollment and retention data of immigrant students before and after the initiative of concern. ([[@2022aitkenshadle_future]])

> The information from the intake form is then entered by NICC staff into the Success Model Student Tracking (SMST) database, an internally-created database used by all programs in NICC's BCS division. AEL instructors and staff track student attendance in a database using Microsoft Excel spreadsheets that are shared with the team using Google Drive. This database was used as a source of data tracking the enrollment and retention of students. As a basis of comparison, data on student enrollment and retention from prior to the implementation of Future Promise was used as part of the study. New databases created using this data and including personally identifying information were stored on a computer using a secure password to ensure the participants' privacy ([[2009 Lin|Lin, 2009]]). [page 45]

I'm curious how they dealt with FERPA and confidentiality while using Google Drive.

> The interviews were between 30 and 60 minutes in length and were semi-structured, meaning that I used a set of prepared questions but also asked follow-up questions as the conversation developed ([[2018 Moser & Korstjens|Moser & Korstjens, 2018]]). [page 46]

- Semi-structured interviews allows for prepared questions but also follow-up questions ([[2018 Moser & Korstjens]]).

> I used a grounded theory approach to coding, identifying themes that emerged from a first reading of the transcripts and then developing further coding as I continued the interviews and engaged in theoretical reflection on the themes that emerged ([[2006 Charmaz|Charmaz, 2006]]). [page 48]

- A grounded theory approach to coding interview data involves identifying emergent themes during the interviewing stage and reflecting on those ([[2006 Charmaz]]).

> One of the most important tools to ensure the trustworthiness of this study is the triangulation of methods, which refers to the use of multiple methods of data collection to help answer the same research problems ([[2017 Hesse-Biber|Hesse-Biber, 2017]]). [page 49]

- Using multiple methods to answer the same research question improves the quality of an action research project ([[2017 Hesse-Biber]]).

> The CASAS exams are standardized assessments that have been evaluated for their accuracy and consistency ([[2020 Jacobsen|Jacobsen, 2020]]). [page 49]

- The CASAS test has been evaluated and is considered to be accurate ([[2020 Jacobsen]]).

Can the same be said for AccuplacerESL? TOEFL? IELTS?

> The credibility for the study in part depends on using a traditional interpretive research method with well-established processes for interviewing, transcribing, and coding data ([[2004 Shenton|Shenton, 2004]]). [page 49]

Interview participants were sampled, but enrollment and retention data were not.
