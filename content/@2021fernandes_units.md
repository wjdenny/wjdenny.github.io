# Units of Exchange

> [!summary] Summary
> Fernandes, Clark-Barnes, & Ortmeier-Hooper (2021) argue that emerging multilingual students need to be graded based on the labor they perform, rather than on what they produce.

## Notes
> In schools, there can be a disconnect between the academic work (work students engage in to earn credits) and identity work (work students engage in to establish and communicate a sense of self) (page 75)

^909e58

> As [[Menken & Garcia (2010)]] have argued, classroom teachers have the role of final arbiters for many aspects of heir classrooms, through explicit policies about language use and, more implicitly, through daily assignments (p. 2) (page 75)

> often, they do not see teachers' attempts at inclusive assignments and projects as providing currency for academic progress within school parameters. (page 75)

[[Students often do not value inclusivity in assignments because the labor involved is not rewarded]]

> their role of comptroller-- deciding the value of students' efforts--can complicate their abilities to recognize the plurilingual potentialities of their classroom. (page 75)

> we argue in this chapter that students' plurilingual identities and resources need to be addressed from a material values standpoint, not simply an altruistic one. (page 75)

[[Researchers argue that the labor of identity building should be rewarded in terms of academic credit]]

> the "coins of the realm" in academic institutions are credits, grades, and academic accolades. These are material items that students can leverage into other material, coin-like benefits: scholarships, grants, awards, monies, paying internships, and expanded networks. (page 75)

> we argue that teachers need to explicitly acknowledge (read: compensate/pay) the labor required to invoke plurilingual resources for academic currency. This requires teachers to consider the entire classroom ecology ([[Resources/Articles/Inoue (2015)|Inoue, 2015]]). (page 76)

> To make time visible, [[Inoue (2014a)|Inoue (2014)]] lays out all the processes where he can locate labor in his first-year writing class such as reading, writing, reflecting, and assessment (pp. 75--79). (page 76)

> We argue that teachers should be careful to reward the discrete moments of private and public laboring of a student interviewing a family member or roommate in order to write a report may only be reflected in a grade for the written report. Instead, the labor may be more fairly recognized through component tasks, such as grading the conducting of the interview as one step and the write-up that follows it as another. (page 76)

This would be great, but how can the teacher evaluate whether or how the student conducted the interview if they are not there to see it? Maybe it could be recorded, but that has logistical and legal challenges, as well as requiring more time for the teacher to evaluate.

> [[Norton Peirce (1995)]] argues that learning opportunities can increase the range of identity options and cultural capital available to learners. (page 77)

> the learning opportunities teachers create affect how students think of themselves and what hey can do as a result of investing in the learning opportunities. (page 77)

[[Classroom and homework activities can affect students' self-perception and self-efficacy]]

> When students perceive that there is a social or academic cost to employing multilingual resources and no benefit, then the teachers' efforts can seem futile and impede students' use of these resources. Students can often sense when choosing to employ multilingualism will have facilitative effects, meaning that they lead to student identity development and academic reward. But multilingual resources can have frictional effects-- negative social and academic consequences. For example, if a student identifies themselves as multilingual, the teacher could decide *to only* provide feedback about language use and sentence-level errors, overlooking the student's other competencies and opportunities for growth. (page 77)

[[There are costs for students in volunteering multilingual information or labor]]

> For classroom teachers, then, this move toward more facilitative opportunities for plurilingual engagement begins with understanding how to build a classroom ecology that values multilingual resources, and then, most importantly, builds upon that ecology with assignments that make pathways to future material benefits more evident to students. (page 77)

> If we, as teachers, view plurilingual identities as resources, then we also must attend to the need for classroom ecologies that value the labor required of the student to share those resources, instead of focusing on students' multilingual competencies as rare commodities, which can feel exoticizing to students. [[@2022inoue_labor|Inoue's (2019)]] definition of classroom ecologies centers the teacher, students, and assignments within it. His view aims toward creating a classroom ecology that minimizes the potential for unfairness-- a potential that may be motivated by implicit biases as located in classism, racism, sexism and ableist expectations, for example. (page 77--78)

> By creating such an ecology, students' diverse experiences, competencies, and identity resources become de-exoticized, thereby allowing teachers to minimize the potential for unfairness. addition, we highlight Inoue's emphasis on action. As Inoue writes, 
>
> Ecology implies action, or doing things and things being done. It assumes activity and change. The idea that ecologies are fundamentally systems of change and action agrees with the way many have understood language as a system too. ([[Resources/Articles/Inoue (2015)|2015]], p. 81)  (page 78) 

> The ecology of the classroom, then, must be predicated on how assignments value students' labor and what the labor means. Assignments and assessments, after all, are not neutral. The ability to make this connection clear may explain the growing interest in and popularity of labor-based grading contracts. We agree with Inoue's assertion that labor-based contracts make time visible and endorse an assessment ecology that values the ubiquitous, but less visible labor that students undertake to engage their embodied cultural capital, or the knowledge and competencies students acquire inside and outside of formal education, which we argue should be translated into academic capital. (page 78)

> Students can then be more strategic, and have more agency, in deciding when and which parts of their identities to share with their school community as well as outside the classroom. (page 78)

> For students to invest in academic work, teachers need "to make a meaningful connection between a learner's desire and commitment to learn a language, and the language practices of the classroom or community" ([[2011 Norton & Toohey|Norton & Toohey, 2011]], p. 415) For classroom teachers, then, this move toward more productive opportunities for plurilingual engagement begins with a course ecology that values multilingual resources and then builds upon that ecology with assignments that make pathways to future material benefits more evident to students. (page 79)

[[Teachers can connect language and identity work in the classroom to future benefits through job applications, scholarships, and other opportunities]]

> Under "Skills," she encouraged them to point to reading, oral, and written proficiencies in other languages explicitly. (page 80)

> she suggested they point to their bilingual interactions with customers from the surrounding communities as a strength. (page 80)

> When she encountered languages in student work that she was unfamiliar with, she deferred to students or pulled in community leaders who were fluent in these languages to offer feedback. She used peer groups and parents to investigate how certain job materials were prepared in other countries. In these instances, Candace reported that she often provided more response on document design and the genres/expectations of workplace writing. (page 81)

> recognized that her labor in developing her professional documents, employing her bilingual competences during interviews, and drawing upon plurilingual resources in the classroom were valued in "real-world" professional contexts. (page 81)

This would be useful for the [[Free ESL Program]] but also for [[ELA]] in general.

> [[Resources/Articles/Inoue (2015)|Inoue's (2015)]] invitation to conceptualize labor as the unifying feature in an assessment ecology avoids exoticizing the experiences and resources students choose to invoke in favor of their academic work. (page 82)

> efforts to also include community members and business owners, who are multilingual and employ their own multilingual resources, also works to de-exoticize difference. (page 82)

> For Inoue, it is critical that the assessment ecology consider "how students labor, that students labor, and what the labor means" ([[@2022inoue_labor|Inoue, 2019]], p. 107). In some cases, even with the best of intentions, that labor means nothing in terms of academic currency. (page 82)

> Early on in the course, his students often express concern in class that this assignment feels open-ended. Most don't have much experience with contract grading, which creates a tension of instability until enough time has passed that consistency in the assessment ecology is stable and evident. (page 84)

> We offer the following opportunities and options with a reminder from [[Paulo Freire]] who noted that "it is impossible to export pedagogical practices without re-inventing them." In that spirit, we invite teachers to remix, to innovate, to "recreate and rewrite" our recommendations to meet the needs of their students and the communities that surround their schools ([[1998 Freire|Freire, 1998]], p. 6). (page 88)

> Teachers can invite and encourage students to acknowledge the value of perspectives they encounter in their daily lives that may not be included in many academic texts, such as those perspectives they encounter through music or media they consume or through engagement with social media platforms. (page 88)
>
> Teachers can also explore language diversity by visiting and learning more about neighborhoods, local stores, community organizations, language classes, and festivals, etc. (For more examples, se [[2016 Sharkey|Sharkey, 2016]]) (page 89)

> Teachers may also ask students to identify moments when they encounter language difference, such as in the use of regional colloquialisms or generational slang. (page 89)

[[Students should explore the diversity of dialects around them]]

> In addition, as many US secondary school classrooms move toward competency-based education standards, teachers need to be actively involved-- through participation in curricular committees and state-level boards-- to make sure that an acknowledgements of these plurilingual strengths are built into these standards. (page 89)

[[Faculty need to advocate for inclusion of plurilingual perspectives into competency-based curriculum]]

> Teachers can aim to participate more actively in state-level and local level curricular decisions as one way to begin to connect policy statements to agentive classroom practices. (page 89)

I wonder if this kind of work can be done through [[ISEA]] or [[NEA]].

> To mitigate that sense of risk, teachers should take active steps that support intellectual risk-taking. In practice, teachers can design ecologies of assessment that spell out the labor required for students to undertake various options within the assignment and the currencies connected to those choices. (page 90)

[[Labor-based contract grading supports students as they take risks in their academic work]]

> The teacher can also work to mitigate risk beyond the classroom by actively developing networks of support for students among other teachers, administrators, guidance counselors, community members, and leaders. (page 90)
