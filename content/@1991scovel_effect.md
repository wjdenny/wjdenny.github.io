> "Affect" is a cover term under which is swept a wide range of disparate constructs and behaviors. Included under the rubric of affective variables are such various categories as: "cognitive style" (Brown, 1973), "ego boundaries" (Taylor , 1974), "reserved vs. outgoing personality" (Chastain, 1975), and "adventuresome" (Tucker, Hamayan, & Genesee, 1976). Perhaps the most peculiar candidate of all for an affective construct, and, at the same time, the most indicative of the need for a more precise definition of affect in second language acquisition, is the variable "conformist Protestant ethic" suggested by Scoon (1971). [page 15]

> As Lamendella (1977) has wryly observed, there are two kinds of researchers who deal with cognition, those who define it erroneously, and those who don't define it at all.

[[The concept of affective and cognitive variables is messy and ill-defined.]]

> The research into the relationship of anxiety to foreign language learning has provided mixed and confusing results, immediately suggesting that anxiety itself is neither a simple nor well-understood psychological construct and that it is perhaps premature to attempt to relate it to the global and comprehensive task of language acquisition. Some studies have revealed incomplete correlations between anxiety and measures of language proficiency; Swaim and Burnaby (1976), for example, in their study of English-speaking French immersion children found a negative correlation between anxiety and one measure of the children's proficiency in French, but, at the same time, found no other significant correlations,m either negative or positive, with any other proficiency measures. Tucker et al., also found that anxiety (in this case, one of a cluster of variables in a factor analysis) correlated again with one measure of French proficiency, but not with any of the three other criterion measures of language proficiency which they examined. ... Backman (1976) found that the two worst English-learning Spanish speakers in her study scored the highest and the lowest on the anxiety measure she utilized. In a larger study, Chastain (1975) found a negative correlation between French audio-lingual method student Scores on tests and anxiety, but, and contradiction, he discovers a positive correlation between anxiety and the scores of German and Spanish students using the traditional method. Chastain accurately identifies the crux of the problem in these anxiety studies when he states that: **"perhaps some concern about a test is a plus or too much anxiety can produce negative results"** (p. 160)

[[Evidence of the affect that anxiety has on language learning is mixed]]

> If Chastain's paper indicates the direction toward which anxiety/language studies should move, it is an article by Kleinmann (1977) which actually takes a step in the right direction, first by defining two different types of anxiety, and then seeking to discover a correlation between these two different constructs and measures of second language learning behavior. Kleinmann was interested in examining the relationship between the syntactic structures in English they're avoided by foreign students and syntactic structures of the students native languages-- the hypothesis being that the English structures which contrasted most markedly with the native language of the student would be avoided most frequently. After examining the English output of Arabic and Spanish students using a variety of tests, Kleinmann was able to confirm his hypothesis. Of secondary interest to him was the relationship between the avoidance behavior of the subjects and anxiety, the assumption being that "facilitating anxiety" would encourage learners to employ the very English structures that their native language group would tend to avoid.

[[There are two types of anxiety when it comes to language learning; facilitating anxiety and debilitating anxiety.]]

> Even though language learning is largely a cerebral, rather than physical endeavor, it is related in many ways to the acquisition of athletic skills, especially the neuromuscular task of speaking (Scovel, 1973), and it might be worthwhile to investigate the possible relationship between psychological measures of emotional arousal and success in foreign language performance, especially in articulatory tasks. [page 20]

[[Linguistic (especially oral) performance shares a lot in common with athletic performance.]]

> The other two measures of affective arousal, paper and pencil tests of behavior and self-reports, are not as easily quantifiable as this physiological tests, but they do have an advantage and that they are much more precise and focusing in on a specific affective construct, say anxiety, then the physical measures which can only assume to be related to affective involvement; in addition, these behavioral measures are easy to administer to large groups of subjects. For these reasons they have been used more abundantly in applied psychology than the physiological tests. These behavioral tests are numerous and include, among others, the following: the Achievement Anxiety Test (AAT), the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale (MAS), the Yale Test Anxiety Scales (TAS), the State/Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Test Anxiety Scale for Children (TASC), the Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (CMAS), and the Digit Span Test.

[[There are several pen and paper tests that can be used to measure anxiety.]]

> higher states of anxiety facilitate learning at upper levels of intelligence whereas they are associated with poorer performance at lower IQ levels, ceteris paribus (Verma & Nijhawan, 1976); furthermore, increased anxiety is likely to improve performance at later stages in a learning activity, but conversely hinders academic performance at earlier stages of the same activity (Beeman, Martin, & Meyers, 1972) [page 20]

> Spielberger (1966a) has presented an elaborate model which effectively integrates intelligence, stage of learning, and difficulty of task into an examination of the impact of anxiety on learning performance. In brief, the model claims that high anxiety (HA) facilitates learning when the task is relatively easy but leads to decrements in performance when the task becomes more difficult. This means that for low IQ students with HA motivation, simple tasks will be learned well with little or no initial exposure, intermediate tasks will be learned well after increased exposure, and that difficult tasks will probably be learned poorly, if at all, even after periods of long exposure. For high IQ students with HA drive, simple and intermediate tasks will be learned well irrespective of exposure, and for difficult tasks although there might be a decrement in performance at the initial stages of the task, HA will eventually facilitate high levels of performance after a period of increased exposure. Consequently, Spielberger's model suggests that whereas HA will eventually provide positive motivation for high IQ students learning a difficult skill, it will provide negative reinforcement to the low IQ student, even under continued exposure to the activity to be acquired. [page 20--21]

[[Anxiety makes easier tasks easier and harder tasks harder]]

> On the one hand, some researchers feel that momentary anxiety should be distinguished from a more permanent predisposition to be anxious, and that this dichotomy would help to account for some of the conflicting results of previous anxiety studies. This sentiment led Spielberger, Gorsuch, and Lushene (1970) to develop a measure which distinguishes between state anxiety (SA) and trait anxiety (TA), as a distinction which appears to resolve some of the discrepancies of earlier studies which failed to consider this parameter of subject behavior (Hodges &  Spielberger, 1969). [page 21]

[[Including a parameter to distinguish task-specific and generalized anxiety improves the accuracy for models of anxiety studies.]]

What about anxiety related to one's identify and place in society (i.e., queer, African-American, immigrant, poor, etc.)
