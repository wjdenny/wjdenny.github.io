# Literature Review of Contract Grading for Multilingual and ESOL Writing Classes

> [!summary] Summary
> Van Valkenburgh reviews the literature on contract grading, focusing on Shor, Danielewicz & Elbow, and Inoue. 

## Notes
This was a PhD thesis from [[San Francisco State University]].

> Contract grading is frequently advanced out of a desire to be more fair and equitable to students with grading (page v)

> learning contracts (page 1)

What are learning contracts, and how are they different from contract grading?

> the assumption that ESOL students' learning needs are to a great extend shared in common with the needs of native English speaking students, and that it makes contract grading valuable for writing instruction (Cox, 2014). This includes not only similar academic needs, such as the ability to write persuasively, but also the affective needs of students related to fairness and equity concerning decisions about style, dialect use, and language varieties. (page 2)

> also issues related to the subjectivity and reliability of grade norming ([[2009 Shor|Shor, 2009]]; [[2009 Danielewicz & Elbow|Danielewicz & Elbow, 2009]]; [[Inoue (2015) 1|Inoue, 2016]], [[@2022inoue_labor|2019]]; [[2020 Schwarz|Schwarz, 2020]]). (page 2)

> contract grading may be beneficial when teachers decide that a process stance to writing is a preferred method for students to achieve greater writing proficiency ([[2006 Elbow|Elbow, 2006]]; [[2009 Danielewicz & Elbow|Danielewicz & Elbow, 2009]]). (page 2)

> A term that is coming to represent a modern recognition of the reality about the way we use language is translingualism (page 2)

> quite a few of my graduate teaching assistant peers adopted contract grading as central to their assessment practice and chose not to grade students based on an evaluation of their writing, opting instead of to grade attendance, labor, and participation related to writing. I, on the other hand, settled on a hybrid grading scheme that incorporated elements of contract grading, such as low-stakes ungraded pass/fail reading and writing assignments, with three major essay assignments that were graded more traditionally. (page 3)

> met the basic requirements of the writing assignment in the form of a rubric, which they helped co-create (page 3)

> Students had the opportunity to revise their main essays and increase those grades with no time limits or penalties, and a substantial number of students did so. (page 3)

> One way to think of contract grading is as a method of assessment where a teacher forges an agreement with their students that to earn a specified grade, they must accomplish a specific set of tasks for that grade, A typical example from the 1960s or 70s might approximate this description by [[Yarber (1973)]]:
> 
> > The contract system determined grades by a contractual agreement, established in advance and signed by the student, which stipulated in detail the quantity and quality of work that must be completed to earn the chosen grade. This evaluation method was also frequently called contract-for-grade method, learning contract, student contract, contract method, and contract learning method. (p. 11)
> (page 3)

> moving away from grades is not a requirement of contract grading ([[1999 Shor|Shor, 1999]], [[2009 Shor|2009]]; [[2009 Danielewicz & Elbow|Danielewicz & Elbow, 2009]]; [[Inoue (2015) 1|Inoue, 2015]], [[@2022inoue_labor|2019]]; [[2020 Schwarz|Schwartz, 2020]]) (page 4)

> the use of contract grading might be attractive to teachers is related to difficulties of assessing in light of how standards for what constitutes good writing change based on numerous contextualized reasons for writing, as well as the variety of lenses from which one might assess writing quality ([[2009 Shor|Shor, 2009]]; [[2009 Danielewicz & Elbow|Danielewicz & Elbow, 2009]]; [[2006 Elbow|Elbow, 2006]]; [[@2022inoue_labor|Inoue, 2019]]). (page 4)

> important factors for evaluating writing ... an understanding of the students' dialect and language use backgrounds ([[2012 Gee|Gee, 2012]]) (page 4--5)

> writing can also be complicated by its inherent subjectivity (page 5)

> In the first wave, ... [w]riting assessment focused largely on grammar and usage, and employed methods such as multiple-choice exams ([[1999 Yancey|Yancey, 1999]]). (page 6)

> The second wave of assessment saw more of a focus on individual essays, and assessments started to be more concerned with the writer, as opposed to objective measures of the text ... then moved from assessing the discreet essay to assessing multiple drafts, and to portfolio assessment. In the third wave of writing assessment. (page 6)

> In the third wave of writing assessment, the role of self-assessment and the social dimension became more recognized and a pedagogy of assessment emerged that is much more self-conscious (Yancey, 1999). (page 6)

> a fourth wave has emerged with a focus on fairness and equity, and an awareness that the evaluation of writing to some degree constrains, or even shapes, the writer. (page 6)

> there has long been a move to decenter or even to eliminate grades for assessment in writing (Kohn, 2013), in part, because grades and evaluations include judgements about cultural beliefs and assumptions that affect identity ([[2002 Huot|Huot, 2002]]). (page 6)

> others still feel that writing assessment is an important and necessary part of the way we teach writing ([[2002 Huot|Huot, 2002]]; [[2006 Martin & Penrod|Martin & Penrod, 2006]]; [[2009 Shor|Shor, 2009]]; [[2006 Elbow|Elbow, 2006]]). (page 6)

> The ranking and grading of students, generally, has been called into question by many researchers (Kohn, 2013; Inoue, 2019), ... the grading of academic writing has been criticized for numerous reasons since at least the early 20th century ([[1973 Yarber|Yarber, 1973]]; [[1971 Taylor|Taylor, 1971]], [[1980 Taylor|1980]]). (page 7)

> often related to questions surrounding the teachers' ability to apply universal standards to writing, also known as grade norming, due to the inherent subjectivity of writing assessment. (page 7)

> some stakeholders questioned the utility of grading as a means to further the development of students' ability to learn to write well, which was sometimes associated with producing good citizenship ([[1971 Taylor|Taylor, 1971]], [[1980 Taylor|1980]]; [[2009 Shor|Shor, 2009]]; [[2013 Kohn|Kohn, 2013]]). (page 7)

> increasingly, grades are criticized for cultural, racial, and linguistic reasons ([[2009 Shor|Shor, 2009]]; [[2009 Danielewicz & Elbow|Danielewicz & Elbow, 2009]]; [[2014 Inoue|Inoue, 2014]], [[@2022inoue_labor|2019]]; [[2012 Gee|Gee, 2012]]; [[2020 Schwartz|Schwartz, 2020)]]. This criticism is in part due to the changing demographics of American society over the last half-century, and also due to the advances in the understanding of language in all its varieties, the proliferation of global communities, and the spread of cultural pluralism. (page 7)

> The role of technology and the internet is another factor that is rapidly changing our society and the way that we think about things ([[2012 Haidt|Haidt, 2012]]). (page 7)

What is the role of internet in the development of cultural pluralism?

> The idealism of teachers needs to be balanced against the needs and desires of students. Especially since assessments and grades can impact students in numerous ways, such as those that impact their identity, which include considerations of their self and culture, race, ethnicity, or other aspects of identity such as choice of major and future occupation. (page 8)

> One way to define Identity is "as the set of possible meanings of roles in the form of expectations of others for one or more of these possible meanings [multiple selves]. They require that the meanings be internalized by actors" ([[2014 Brenner, Serpe & Stryker|Brenner, Serpe & Stryker, 2014]], p. 232). Moreover, how we grade students can affect their self-esteem and motivation towards school work, and **it is important to remember that ==grades have a gatekeeper function that affects students' ability to be accepted or enrolled into subsequent classes, programs, schools==, and grades may eventually impact their occupations.** (page 8)

> many scholars argue that applying a specified native English standard to ESOL students is unfair, and as problematic as standards may be for native students of different dialect backgrounds, it can be particularly unfair when applied to the academic writing of ESOL students ([[2014 Cox|Cox, 2014]]; [[2014 Madura|Madura, 2014]]; [[2016 Lee|Lee, 2016]]).

> and that native-like writing cannot, and should not, be the goal. (page 9)

> many of us consider it to be unethical to demand native-like (or error-free) writing from L2 students['] (p. 308). (page 9)

> Inoue, ([[Resources/Articles/Inoue (2015)|2015]], [[@2022inoue_labor|2019]]) argue more strongly that evaluating writing based on a standard academic English dialect is racist and is promoting white supremacy. (page 9)

> whether one agrees with Inoue, or not, common sense suggests that grading students from different language backgrounds by any single dialectal standard likely has the effect of privileging some students and disadvantaging others. (page 9)

> thinking of language through [a] translingual approach may help us appreciate the reality that language is ever-changing and negotiable since the translingual approach recognizes these complexities of language ([[Horner, et al. (2011)|Horner, Lu, Royster & Trimbur, 2011]]; [[2014 Matsuda|Matsuda, 2014]]; [[2016 Lee|Lee, 2016]]).
> 
> > We call for a new paradigm: a translingual approach. This approach sees difference in language not as a barrier to overcome or as a problem to manage, but as a resource for producing meaning in writing, speaking, reading, and listening (p. 303).
>  (page 9)

[[Translingualism approaches language as something flexible and primarily as a tool for constructing meaning using a variety of linguistic resources]]

> The rules of good writing might not only include rules of grammar or style but also might include attempts to write in such a way as to please the teacher's intellectual, social, or political preferences. (page 9)

> we risk students orienting their writing toward the goal of earning a grade and attempting to please the teacher, rather than writing as a part of an intrinsically motivated intellectual pursuit, or, perhaps, to explore the limits of their creativity. (page 9--10)

> [[Inoue (2019)]], when he says grading, "is a distraction that pulls students away from the real dialogues and discussions about their writing that we want to have" (p. 5). (page 10)

> the process is often subordinated by the students' desire to earn high grades, and this is a primary motive of [[2009 Danielewicz & Elbow|Danielewicz and Elbow (2009)]]. (page 10)

> scholars that advocate political resistance to grading based on assertions of racism, power differentials, or even criticism of capitalism, sometimes as part of a doctrine referred to as "critical theory," which seems to be short for "critical social theory" (CST) ([[2009 Shor|Shor, 2009]]; [[Inoue (2015) 1|Inoue, 2014]], [[@2022inoue_labor|2019]]). (page 10)

> [[2009 Danielewicz & Elbow|Danielewicz and Elbow (2009)]] in a discussion, appears to both praise and critique the critical theory focus, a focus that they do not embrace:
> 
> > They [CST] seek to authorize students to take as much control as possible over their lives as individuals and as a community. Many important course policies like attendance and workload are worked out through class votes and mutual negotiation with the teacher. Seeking not just to democratize the classroom but in fact to work against the ideology of capitalism and class privilege, Shor and his colleagues have turned to contract grading as one method. We will compare their uses of contracts and goals with ours. There are striking differences, yet we also feel some comradeship. (p. 245) (page 10)

> criticism of traditional grading concerns itself with linguistics, ... largely concerned with how teachers apply a dominant standard, code[,] or dialect of language to students who grow up with different levels of exposure to these dialects. (page 10--11)

> The concern is that these dialects privilege students with familiarity to these standard or academic dialects of English, for instance, middle class students whose parents graduated from colleges and may speak the dialect in the home ([[2012 Gee|Gee,2012]]). On the one hand, Inoue ([[Resources/Articles/Inoue (2015)|2015]], [[@2022inoue_labor|2019]]) has argued that grading often imposes a standard that is based on the habitus of the teacher and the institution, which according to Inoue, is a system predicated on "White supremacy." (page 11)

Van Valkenburgh offers no rebuttal or explanation for his denigration of Inoue's anti-racist and anti-supremacist leanings. It strikes me more as thinly veiled conservatism trying to maintain the status quo through silence and feigned ignorance.

He accepts the conclusion that standard language ideology is problematic, and agrees that we should be willing to challenge the status quo, but denies scholarship on the origins of this ideology in white supremacy and its pervasiveness in society based, it seems, solely on his disagreement with those scholars political leanings. 

> his concern that grading reflects a standard (dialect or genre) that may not be native to many of the students in the writing class, and particularly, students of color is compelling, and so it follows that if this is true for native English speakers of different backgrounds, then this understanding can be extended to ESOL students who may also be disadvantaged from an adherence to a single dominant dialect or code of English. (page 11)

> not teaching the dominant language codes have also been argued to disadvantage students (Shor, 20099; Lee, 2016). Many favor embracing a more flexible approach toward language dialects or codes, and believe that the inherent flexibility of contract grading enables us to remedy these and other considerations around grading, as opposed to traditional grading, since contract grading can take into consideration the differing needs to students and apply multiple strategies. (page 11)

> Contract grading, as an alternative to traditional methods of grading, has been discussed in academic circles since the early part of the twentieth century ([[1973 Yarber|Yarber, 1973]], p. 22); however the practice of popularity during the late 1960s and 1970s as teachers again started to question the status quo around traditional assessment practices ([[1971 Taylor|Taylor, 1971]], [[1980 Taylor|1980]]; [[1975 Hart|Hart, 1975]]). (page 12)

[[Ideological neutrality in education only serves to support the current dominant ideologies]] and [[Education is never ideological neutral]] ([[Benesch (1993)]])


> during the 1990s, a renewed interest in contract grading emerged in the teaching of writing ([[1999 Shor|Shor, 1999]], [[2009 Shor|2009]]; [[2009 Danielewicz & Elbow|Danielewicz & Elbow, 2009]]; [[Inoue (2015) 1|Inoue, 2015]], [[@2022inoue_labor|2019]]; [[2020 Schwarz|Schwartz, 2020]]). (page 12)

> into the new millennium ... an emphasis on social justice, often attached to critical social theory ([[1999 Shor|Shor, 1999]]; [[Inoue (2015) 1|Inoue, 2015]]; [[@2022inoue_labor|2019]]; [[2020 Schwarz|Schwarz, 2020]]). (page 12)

> contract grading is increasingly associated with critical race theory ([[Inoue (2015) 1|Inoue, 2015]], [[@2022inoue_labor|2019]];[[2020  Schwarz| Schwarz, 2020]]), which should be understand as more narrowly focused on race. (page 12)

> there has been a substantial interest in contract grading outside of writing instruction as contract grading has been explored in a variety of other academic subjects, for instance: including, but not limited to mathematics, health, history, and psychology ([[1973 Yarber|Yarber, 1973]]; [[1975 Hart|Hart, 1975]]; [[2011 Lindemann & Harbke|Lindemann & Harbke, 2011]]; [[2020 Mullen|Mullen, 2020]]) (page 12)

> its popularity for its emphasis on "process writing" in writing classrooms has remained a long standing and important motivation in its own right. (page 12)

> Peter Elbow, and of [[2009 Danielewicz & Elbow|Danielewicz and Elbow (2009)]] who emphasize that one of the main values of contract grading is its emphasis on the actual practice, or process of writing, as opposed to the emphasis on grades (pp. 241, 261). (page 12)


> [[Lindemann & Harbke (2011)]] investigated the effectiveness of contract grading by comparing otherwise identical psychology courses, which compared to contract grading alongside the same curriculum that used a traditional grading scheme, and they found some qualified benefits to contract grading, for instance, related to motivation and learning, but the benefits were not universal amongst students. (page 13)

[[Studies show some students benefit from contract grading in terms of motivation and learning, but results were mixed]]

> [[Schwarz (2020)]] also found mixed results, and in an example to the contrary, discusses a teacher who found it harder to motivate students with contract grading "This teacher is concerned with a similar kind of resistance associated with a lack of motivation. In these cases, removing the grade, according to these responses, removes the students' incentives for doing the required work of the course, like revisions (p. 54)["]. Additionally, [[Inoue (2019)]], who is mostly positive about using contract grading, discusses how there are some students who are resistant to not being graded traditionally, suggesting that this is in part due to their familiar with traditional grading. (page 13)

[[Some students may resist contract grading due to its unfamiliarity]]

> [[Shor (2009)]], [[2009 Danielewicz & Elbow| Danielewicz and Elbow (2009)]], and [[@2022inoue_labor|Inoue,s (2019)]] contract grading models come up for discussion frequently when discussing contract grading, and one of those three models are often adopted or modified by new teachers thinking about assessment, and by experienced teachers seeking to change from their traditional assessment practices ([[2020 Schwarz|Schwarz, 2020]]). (page 14)

> generally, each contract seeks to set out an agreement between the teacher and their students on what is expected in the classroom, what are the roles o the teacher and the students, what are the course expectations, and how many interim or final grades are applied to the students' work. (page 14)

> These contracts may also include things like attendance, participation, or other requirements for the course. (page 14)

> Shor also describes his model as one modeled with democracy is mind ([[2009 Shor|2009]], p. 14). Shor teaches his students about democracy by example, and thus, heavily involves his students in the participation of the decision-making process concerning what they choose to write about and how they will be graded. [[Shor (2009)]] negotiates the terms of the grading contract with his students, who act in their role as co-creators of their grading contract (page 15)

> students play a major role in determining the subject of class writing, and they are asked to choose subjects related to current events, which tend to be political in nature, on which the students then vote ([[1999 Shor|Shor,1999]], p. 2) (page 15)

> in response to criticism implying that he pushes politics on students, [[Shor (2009)]] distinguishes the fact that although he is quite political in his scholarly writing and discussion with other teachers, he does not "preach" politics to his students, which he feels would be wrong. Thus, he not only allows students to pick the topics, but [[Shor (2009)]] also allows students the freedom to take whatever political stance they desire in their writing:
> 
> > I don't lecture students (except for the rare practice of "the dialogic lecture," which I described in Empowering Education, 1992). I don't address students about the need to resist capitalism, which would be an abuse of my position. Lecturing or sermonizing students will silence many and encourage others to mimic. (p. 20--21). (page 15)

> "Those few undergraduates en route to graduate or professional schools do need [Standard Written English], research writing, and exposure to the belles-lettres so they can read closely as well as display the cultural capital required to circulate among professionals ([[2009 Shor|Shor, 2009]], p. 10--11). [[Shor (2009)]] model captures what many may perceive to be an influence from the 1960s and 70s social movements that were so influential at the time, with a strong focus on liberal democracy and pluralism. (page 15)

> "unilateral grading contract" ... students can earn up to a "B" letter grade on the basis of completing the assignments as detailed in the contract, which includes requirements of attendance and tardiness with other requirements, without concern for the quality of the students' writing. (page 16)

> to earn an "A," [[2009 Danielewicz & Elbow|Danielewicz and Elbow (2009)]] expect something in their writing that is "excellent" and stands apart (p. 254). They acknowledge that there is a subjective quality to determining what is excellent writing and satisfy themselves by admitting that this overall process is imperfect, which they justify thus: (page 16)

> [[2009 Danielewicz & Elbow|Danielewicz and Elbow]] mainly focus on writing as a process, and seek to remove as many distractions to writing as possible:
> 
> > The bottom line is that contract grading fosters a deep commitment to process. If we seek to use physical exercise for health or fitness, the message from experienced people is the same: just keep going through the motions; trust it; it's the process that counts. William James famously argued that actions are not caused by emotions or beliefs; rather, actions lead to emotions or beliefs (p. 261)
> (page 17)

[[Contract grading puts emphasis on the processes that lead to learning and acquisition rather than the products]]

Same logic can be applied to asset-focused teaching, growth-mindset, and [Nutrition By Kylie](https://www.youtube.com/c/nutritionbykylie)'s "what can you add" approach to dieting.

> [Inoue's] contract, like Shor's (2009) is negotiated with his students:
> 
> > A labor-based grading contract is essentially a set of social agreements with the entire class about how final course grades will be determined for everyone. These agreements are articulated in a contract, a document, that is negotiated at the beginning of the term or semester, then reexamined at midpoint to make sure it is still fair enough for everyone. It is a social, corporate agreement, which means it may not be a product of full consensus, but instead hard agreements. ([[@2022inoue_labor|Inoue,2019]], p. 30) 
> (page 17)

> Antiracist or Antiracism, as used by Inoue ([[Resources/Articles/Inoue (2015)|2015]], [[@2022inoue_labor|2019]]), is a highly ideological and controversial term, and thus means something more than simply being 'anti-racist' (against racism) (see [[2021 McWhorter|McWhorter, 2021]]). In contract to [[2009 Shor|Shor's (2009)]] broad democratic appeal to critical theory, Inoue ([[Resources/Articles/Inoue (2015)|2015]], [[@2022inoue_labor|2019]]) employs a critical theory lens that is more directly focused on critical race theory. (page 18)

> Thus, in some regards, [[Inoue (2019)]], approaches writing instruction with a more explicit political and sociological mission: "And so, labor-based grading contracts is a big part of the methods I use to enact my social justice agenda in my classroom's antiracist writing assessment ecologies" (p. 16). However, [[Inoue (2019)]] also embraces a much more agreed upon linguistic opposition to grades, as he feels that students shouldn't be held back based on the code or dialect of English that they embody:
> 
> > What I'm saying is that designing fair and meaningful grading practices is about cultivating with our students an ecology, a place where every student, no matter where they come from or how they speak or write, can have access to the entire range of final course grades possible. ([[@2022inoue_labor|Inoue, 2019]], p. 3)
> 
> Interestingly, [[Inoue (2019)]] acknowledges that his pedagogy is paradoxical (p. 306), as his own success is tied to adopting a "white supremacist" habitus, which, by habitus, he describes as linguistic bodily, and performative dispositions (p. 5). Inoue ([[Resources/Articles/Inoue (2015)|2015]], [[@2022inoue_labor|2019]]) clearly considers and embraces both the complexities and paradoxes of his pedagogical stances. (page 18)

Danielewicz, Elbow, and Schwarz are not paradoxical?

> [[Shor (2009)]] differentiates what he terms his "democratic model" from [[2009 Danielewicz & Elbow|Danielewicz and Elbows' (2009)]] which he refers to as a "business model:
> 
> > A 'contract' requires 'a meeting of the minds,' that is, a covenant of explicit understanding between all parties affected by the terms. In this construction, no contract exists if one party unilaterally obliges another to abide by terms to which the second party did not formally consent" ([[2009 Shor|Shor, 2009]], p. 13)
> > 
>  (page 19)

[[Shor argues that there is no real contract if it is entirely unilateral]]

What about terms of service and privacy statements? Don't those act as unilateral contracts? 

> Inoue's ([[2004 Inoue|2004]], 2019) [[Community-based Assessment]] concept involves the class creating a single community-rubric.  (page 20)

For our goal is to create a classroom where both teachers and students get to give as much time and attention as possible to writing-- not to politics and culture.

This is absurd. Writing is culture. Teaching is culture, and both are political.

[[It is dangerous to ignore the ideologies inherent in TESOL]]

My plan, is it contract grading or competency based?

> Teachers may also need to take into consideration the role and desires of other stakeholders. (page 21)

> though some teachers are motivated by political, sociological, and ideological considerations associated with race, equity, or other aspects of identity, it is also not sufficient to understand contract grading as requiring any particular ideological, sociological, or political foundation ([[1980 Taylor|Taylor, 1980]]; [[2009 Danielewicz & Elbow|Danielewicz & Elbow, 2009]]; [[2020 Schwarz|Schwarz, 2020]]) (page 21)

contract grading is qualitative, or not strictly quantitative? maybe not

> some teachers resist or seek to depoliticize the classroom ([[2009 Danielewicz & Elbow|Danielewicz & Elbow, 2009]]; [[1999 Elbow|Elbow, 1999]], [[2006 Elbow|2006]]; [[2020 Schwarz|Schwarz, 2020]]) (page 21)

> then what does it require? On the simplest level, one might argue that virtually every class employs contract grading since most classes set out certain intrinsic expectations between teachers and students, whether those expectations are understood explicitly or implicitly, and though contract grading in its simplest form maybe understood as a contractual agreement between a teacher and students, it appears that the difference is in the understanding that contract grading exists as an alternative to traditional grading practices ([[1978 Taylor|Taylor, 1978]]; [[2009 Shor|Shor, 2009]]; [[2009 Danielewicz & Elbow|Danielewicz & Elbow, 2019]]; [[@2022inoue_labor|Inoue, 2019]]; [[2020 Schwarz|Schwarz, 2020]]). (page 21--22)

so is contract grading just the expectations of the course made explicit? so anyone with a syllabus is already doing contract grading?

> The models previously discussed highlight three major considerations around contract designs. For instance, in one form, the teacher designs the contract largely according to their preexisting determination, creates at least most of the contract unilaterally, and then asks students to consent to the teacher's design. The second model of contract grading is created through mutual negotiation between the teacher and their students resulting in a contract where student participation in the design is considerable. and the third contract grading model represents some combination of these methods, a degree of unilateral and mutual design ([[2009 Shor|Shor, 2009]]; [[2009 Danielewicz & Elbow|Danielewicz & Elbow, 2009]]; [[Inoue (2015) 1|Inoue, 2014]], [[@2022inoue_labor|2019]];[[2020  Schwarz| Schwarz, 2020]]). (page 22)

[[Grading contracts can range from entirely unilateral agreements to fully negotiated between teacher and students]]

> negotiations may continue until some minimal criteria that the teacher desires is proposed and included in the final agreement. In other words, teachers can keep the negotiation in process until it reaches a conclusion that is satisfying to the teacher. This may include some coaxing by the teacher, i.e., What about including a requirement for "readability"? In some cases, this begs the question of whether, in practice, a teacher guides their students during negotiation toward an agreement that is more or less similar to how one would appear if it was a unilateral contract, like [[2009 Danielewicz & Elbow|Danielewicz and Elbow's (2009)]] contract? (page 22--23)

[[Even negotiated grading contracts can easily be functionally unilateral]]

> Nevertheless, despite any tendency for the final design to approximate the teacher's preconceived will, students can have some real input into the final contract and this process can offer students a number of benefits pedagogically. At the very least, a contract with the students may help the students feel that they have buy-in, or a commitment to the contract by virtue of their input into its design and by their explicit consent ([[1976 Hart|Hart, 1976]]; [[2011 Lindemann & Harbke|Lindemann & Harbke, 2011]]). The more that teachers are aware of their own metacognitive processes in designing a contract grading model the better for all. (page 23)

> A position reason to consider implementing contract grading is that a number of teachers claim that contract grading helps students to focus on learning, and as a result become better writers, by removing their fear and anxiety about grading ([[2009 Danielewicz & Elbow|Danielewicz & Elbow, 2009]]) (page 23)

> Contract grading may be an attractive option because it works well to remedy the various traditional and modern pedagogical and epistemic problems and conflicts around assessment and it accommodates the different ways that we use the English language, apart from sometimes outmoded monolingual models. (page 23--24)

> Such standardized dialects work well for students that are experienced in these dialects, particularly when they are used in the home. For students with less experience, this can put them at a disadvantage, so It is important to consider the language background of the students that we teach. [[Gee (2012)]] explains how this affects students:
> 
> > School is, as it is presently constituted, ultimately all about learning specialist varieties of language, in particular academic varieties of language connected to content areas. Some children bring early prototypes of academic varieties of language to school-- prototypes they have learned at home. Some do not. (p. 16)
> 
> He goes on to explain:
> 
> > This is because schools do not start the academic language acquisition process for these children-- a process that has already started at home for other children. Rather, they teach these children to "read" only in the sense of being able to do phonics and dealing with the superficial literal meanings of words mostly in the vernacular. Poor children suffer the same sort of plight that someone who tries to pass French 4 without French 1, French 2, and French 3 does. This problem doesn't say much about the children's abilities, thought it says a lot about the schooling system they are in. (p. 17)
> > 
> page (24)

> ideas about what are standard dialects are subject to constant change as there exist many varieties of language, both within and outside of English, and many, if not most of us code switch regularly, so it is incumbent upon us to rethink and expand our understanding of the English language, especially in this modern world where it is normal to interact with language users across the globe in person or on social media. (page 24--25)

> > Actually, it's not one thing, it's many things. There are many different varieties of English. Some of these are different dialects spoken in different regions of the country or by different sociocultural groups. Some of them are different varieties of language used by different occupations or for different specific purposes: for example, the language of bookies, lawyers, or video game players (p. 14)
> 
> page (25)

> It is incumbent upon us to expand our understanding of what constitutes acceptable varieties of English used in academia as we assign and assess student writing with respect to dialects. In order to be more fair, it seems that we should embrace a translingual approach to language.
> 
> The translingual approach to language and writing addresses fairness by recognizing how the notion of an idealized English does not reflect the linguistic reality of many English language users attending colleges and universities, and this is also true with ESOL students who come from diverse language and dialect backgrounds ([[2014 Cox|Cox, 2014]]; [[2012 Gee|Gee, 2012]]; [[2016 Lee|Lee, 2016]]; [[2014 Matsuda|Matsuda, 2014]]; [[Horner, et al. (2011)|Horner, Lu, Royster, & Trimbur, 2011]]; [[1999 Ramanatham & Atkinson|Ramanatham & Atkinson, 1999]]). (page 25)

> Sometimes it is seen as repudiating dominant dialects of the sort that Inoue ([[Resources/Articles/Inoue (2015)|2015]], [[@2022inoue_labor|2019]]) criticizes as a white supremacist variety, but this is typically not the case. Thus, [[Matsuda (2014)]] argues that it is incumbent upon us to define 'translingual':
> 
> > "Over the last few years, I have reviewed numerous manuscripts submitted to major journals in the field, and while many of them mention translingual writing as necessary for their work, they often fail to define the concept or to use it consistently' (p. 479).
> 
> > page (25)

> as I interpret Matsuda, translingualism is not an attempt to discredit the old (SAE) in favor of a new standard, but to recognize that how we use language is highly contextualized depending on many factors, such as the position of the writer, audience, community of practice, and the language most effective for communicating within this context, [a]s Lee (2013) notes:
> 
> > While we certainly should continue to legitimize language practices that have historically been marginalized, including elements of translingual writing that historically have been neglected in academic contexts, there is a fine line between what constitutes "translingual" and "monolingual" and assessment practices driven by a desire to promote linguistic social justice must avoid reifying a false translingual-monolingual dichotomy as a means of uncritically valorizing the translingual over the monolingual. (p. 187)
> 
> In short, the varieties of language used, taught, and assessed in the classroom require that we deeply consider the purpose, audience, and rhetorical needs of the students.
> (page 26)

What is the difference between [[Plurilingualism]] and [[Translingualism]]?

Most of my students are not even getting a 4-year degree-- so SAE/AE is not their goal and would be unfair to expect that.

> This does not necessarily require that we elevate nonstandard dialects or that standard dialects are assailed. We may need to recognize the legitimacy of both along a continuum. (page 26--27)

> numerous ways and reasons to consider implementing contract grading, whether to make grading easier, to focus on the writing process, or to establish a grading method that promotes fairness and equity with respect to diverse social, cultural, and language background ([[2006 Elbow|Elbow, 2006]]; [[2009 Danielewicz & Elbow|Danielewicz & Elbow, 2009]]; [[2009 Shor|Shor, 2009]]; [[2012 Gee|Gee, 2012]]; [[Inoue (2015) 1|Inoue, 2014]], [[@2022inoue_labor|2019]]; [[2020 Schwarz|Schwarz, 2020]]). (page 27)

> [[Schwarz (2020)]] calls for de-norming grading and uses contract grading without evaluating writing for grades: "Classroom assessment genres are full of arbitrary features that we often take for granted as necessary or 'just the way it is.'" (p. 31). Another reason for contract grading (especially suited to my own philosophy) is that contract grading can empower students, and is therefore student-centered since students have more input and freedom that hopefully leads to more student agency ([[1975 Hart|Hart, 1975]]; [[1999 Shor|Shor, 1999]]; [[1999 Elbow|Elbow, 1999]]). (page 27)

> contract grading can be adopted for a variety of reasons or in conjunction with a range of ideologies. (page 28)

> At many colleges and universities it is common for first-year writing classes to have native English speakers who speak multiple dialects of English, for example, African American Vernacular, Chicano English, etc., or dialects based on socioeconomic class and regional Englishes. In addition to these classes may include one or more students who are bilingual, but have English as their dominant language ([[1999 Shor|Shor, 1999]]; [[2014 Cox|Cox, 2014]]; [[Inoue (2015) 1|Inoue, 2016]], [[@2022inoue_labor|2019]]; [[Horner, et al. (2011)|Horner, Lu, Royster & Trumbur, 2011]]; [[2016 Lee|Lee, 2016]]). (page 28)

> one of the motivations for this capstone is that there is relatively little discussion of contract grading with ESOL students. (page 28)

> contracts are not new to ESOL as TESOL scholarly literature abounds with robust discussions of contracts and autonomous learners ([[2011 Sidhu, Kaur, & Chan|Sidhu, Kaur, & Chan, 2011]]; [[2010 Zhong|Zhong, 2010]]) (page 28--29)

If TESOL scholarly literature abounds with discussions on this topic, how can he also say there is relatively little discussion?

> [[2011 Sidhu, Kaur, & Chan|Sidhu, Kaur, and Chan (2011)]] describe [[Autonomous Learning|autonomous learners]] as those "learners who understand what is being taught, are able to formulate their own learning objectives, are able to select materials, make use of appropriate learning strategies and monitor and self-assess their own learning" (p. 218). (page 29)

It sounds like [[Autonomous Learning]] is a significant field of interest for me.

> learning contracts differ in some ways from contract grading ... for instance, the fact that they are both an agreement between the teacher and the students, that they both require some autonomy from students, and they both allow students more academic freedom since thy require that the students take an active role in both the learning and its assessment. (page 29)

> Prior experience, including culture, and their effects on student beliefs may make contract grading difficult to accept for some ESOL students. (page 29)

[[Zhong (2010)]] makes this point clear in a study on Chinese learners: "However, I argue before promoting autonomous learning, it is essential to detect learners' beliefs" (p. 213). (page 29)

> Some students expect teachers to not only test their learning, but to evaluate and direct their learning. However, this propensity may be stronger in individual students, and it still may be possible to teach students, who are initially resistant, to be comfortable with a more autonomous learning emphasis. (page 29--30)

> previous learning experiences in China where exams were usually high-stake. In other words, the test results played a vital role in their lives. For instance, they were used as the criterion for admission into university, applying for jobs and career promotions. Although they were in New Zealand, the influence from their previous learning still came into play ([[2010 Zhong|Zhong, 2010]], p. 216) (page 30)

[[It's important to consider students' attitudes towards independent styles of learning before implementing them in the classroom]]

> contrary to what many might expect, some students indicate that pressure from the teacher benefits them as the students said that the pressure helps motivate them to revise and summarize their work (page 30)

> Thus, a teacher may need to be flexible as it may be necessary to employ contract grading for the majority of the students and let students opt-out for a more traditional approach. This can be negotiated with the students at the beginning of the course, and it might be good to check in periodically with students to determine whether they want to switch methods. Students who prefer traditional grading can change their might as also evidence by [[Zhong (2010)]]. (page 30)

[[Instead of letting students opt-out, consider working with them to set a more personalized contract]]

The main difference between native and ESOL students with respect to [[Grading Contracts]] is their acceptance of it and their ideas of the teacher's role.

[[I had a student once who had assumptions of a teacher's role that conflicted with my own]]

> Once students accept contract grading, it is clear that many of the same reasons that make contract grading desirable for native English speakers in first-year college writing classes, also apply to multilingual or ESOL writing classes. (page 31)

> It is important to discuss contract grading with students, and it is important for teachers to think through the problems and potential benefits of contract grading. (page 31)

> One must consider the academic and occupational goals of students and the realistic attitudes of those employers outside of academia. As [[Lee (2016)]] argues:
>
> > Linguistic social justice ... thus cannot be reduced to simply inviting alternate discourse styles in academic, even high-stakes, writing without attending to the technologies - placement testing, exit testing, common rubric scoring, among others - and stakeholders who decide when and where such discourse styles will be valued. (p. 176)
> 
> (page 31)

Ask students what their goals are: major, level of education, career, etc.
[[Students may have different goals and it's important to consider those goals when deciding how they will be evaluated]]

> It may be appropriate to heed the once sage advise: "It is sometimes better to know the rules, and once you know the rules, then you can break the rules" (anonymous). And by doing so, thus creating new dominant dialects! (page 32)

New dialects are not usually created by people who "know the rules." The rules are irrelevant.

> we need to explain to these students the various connotations of using English that might not be apparent to them as second language learners ([[2016 Lee|Lee, 2017]], p. 177). A translingual orientation toward language teaching should not be limited to advocating for the linguistic rights of ESOL students alone. It is important to remember that certain "native speakers" of English, such as students who speak African American Vernacular English, and other dialects have historically been marginalized because of their language differences ([[2012 Gee|Gee, 2012]]; [[2016 Lee|Lee, 2014]], [[Inoue (2015) 1|Inoue, 2015]], [[@2022inoue_labor|2019]]). and thus the decision to teach a dominant academic code, a transgressive code, or perhaps some broader combination of codes may depend on the needs of the students and the context surrounding their writing (page 32)

> the notion of [[Translingualism|translingual writing]] is a work in progress, according to [[2014 Matsuda|Matsuda, 2014]]), scholars who embrace it seem to share the following perspectives:
> 
> > - English monolingualism is prevalent and problematic.
> > - The presence of language differences is normal and desirable.
> > - Languages are neither discrete nor stable; they are dynamic and negotiated.
> > - Practicing translingual writing involves the negotiation of language differences.

> the biggest challenge [of contract grading] can be to convince the students. (page 33)

> determining what is fair and whether to apply ideology to contract grading are not decisions without consequences and should be carefully considered. (page 34)

Ideology is inherent to any policy. Not applying an ideology intentionally, too, should be carefully considered.

> Some are questioning existing standards of academic writing, and yet ultimately, the result of pushing back against some standards might simply be that it may result in a new academic standard. (page 34)

It takes time to develop a standard. I don't think that is a possible outcome of a translingual orientation.

> from the [[Conference on College Composition and Communication (1974)]] Students' Right to their Own Language" and ([[Baker-Bell, et al. (2020)|2020]]) "This Ain't Another Statement! This is a DEMAND for Black Linguistic Justice!," but such demands may not represent the wants or needs of many minority or Black students. (page 35)

Van Valkenburgh presents no example or evidence of this.

> it is important to discuss these issues with other teachers and our students, and to give students a say in these matters. (page 35)

Many students may want to learn AE, but standard practice is still to assume a lot of linguistic and cultural knowledge in teaching it.

> Ultimately, teaching is about the students, so it is important to consider the needs of the students, whether it pertains to their goals as students, or their needs in relation to their language backgrounds-- whether they are native English speakers or ESOL students. (page 35)

> native English speaker with an undergraduate degree in English ... part of that experience and training teaches me that the ideas embodied in translingualism reflect a more accurate view of language so that I must not accept my own languaging habits and as universal and applicable to others. (page 35)

> Teachers should consider their student's language background, their choice of academic major, and their future occupational aspirations as we make choices with respect to teaching and assessing writing. The language needs of a student seeking a degree in the music of Jazz, and that of a student seeking a career in journalism at a national paper or magazine can differ considerably. (page 36)

> I mostly agree with [[2009 Danielewicz & Elbow|Danielewicz and Elbow (2009)]] as I wish to avoid politics in the classroom. However, that does not apply to the political engagement of students who should be encouraged to bring their own views about politics into the classroom. In facilitating the learning of writing, I also agree with [[Shor (2009)]] that students should take whatever stance they hold toward politics in the writing classroom. Part of their journey as students is to explore and create their own ideological perspectives as part of their college experience. (page 36)

I think the author is conflating a political opinion with a ideologically-informed (as all are) teaching practice. I highly doubt Inoue is suggesting that students should *not* have the freedom to express their opinions in writing.

He simply doesn't understand the inherent politically of education, and how that is different from holding a personal political view.

> The main advantages of adopting contract grading are in the way that it involves students in their own education process so that they think about their learning and their writing metacognitively, and in how contract grading takes the traditional emphasis off grades and puts the emphasis on the actual writing or process (some might say learning). (page 38)

> Teachers should approach contract grading with a great deal of flexibility since there may be resistance to it due to how it is nontraditional. Thus for ESOL students, it is important that teachers learn about their students educational background and any cultural practices for which they are accustomed, and that teachers discuss contract grading with students so that they can ascertain the students' attitudes and feelings toward contract grading.
