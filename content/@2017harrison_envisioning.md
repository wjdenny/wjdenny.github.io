## Notes
> While our writing classes are linguistically diverse, the training of most of our program faculty was not so diverse, the result of what Paul Kei Matsuda has described as the disciplinary division of labor (1999). [page 189]

> Our proposal was included in our university's application for a Department of Education Title V grant, and in 2010, the university was awarded $500,000 with the goal of increasing graduation rates at HSIs. Student retention is a concern at HSIs, as in general, HSI graduation rates are lower than those at non-HSI institutions. At FIU, the six-year graduation rate is at 53%, a relatively high percentage when compared with an average of 39% at U.S. HSIs (Núñez & Elizondo, 2012, p. 20). However, when compared to the state's flagship university, University of Florida, with its 89% graduation rate, it is clear that more could be done to assist our multicultural, multilingual, often first-generation-in-college students in their transition to the university and in their efforts to successful degree completion. [page 190]

> CCCC Statement on Second Language Writing and Writers (2001), which states, in part, that universities must "recognize and take responsibility for the regular presence of second language writers in writing classes, to understand their characteristics, and to develop instructional and administrative practices that are sensitive to their linguistic and cultural needs." [page 190]

> Beatrice Mendez Newman argues, drawing on her experience as a writing program administrator at a Texas HSI, thee composition classroom, with its relatively low enrollment and active learning pedagogy, figures "prominently in the HSI student's decision to persist or drop out, to cross the 'threshold' or to retreat from the institution" (2007, p. 23). At FIU, the first-semester writing class is a significant indicator of our students' likelihood for degree completion, as 50% of the students who fail their first composition course leave the university before their second year. [page 190]

> Bruce Horner, Min-Zhan Lu, Jacqueline Jones Royster, and John Trimbur (2011) to "see difference in language not as a barrier to be overcome or as a problem to manage" but as a rhetorical resource (p. 303). [page 190--191]

> "difference-as-a-resource" perspective as opposed to a "difference-as-deficit" view (Canagarajah, 2002, p. 13) and code-meshing, a form of writing in which writers incorporate their own languages and varieties of English with dominant conventions in "rhetorically strategic ways" (Canagarajah, 2006, p. 598; Canagarajah, 2013, p. 40). [page 191]

> Focused on adapting pedagogical strategies to meet the needs of a diverse student audience, the concept of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) was developed by education researchers beginning in the mid-1980s. It builds on the Universal Design movement in architecture and product design that calls for "designs that from the outset accommodate the greatest variety of individuals" (Rose, Meyer, & Hitchcock, 2005, p. 3). UDL has been helpful in thinking about designing a mainstream writing course that meets the needs of both resident ESL and native English speakers by, for example, providing instructions for all activities both verbally and in writing and in choosing carefully academic vocabulary with the different educational histories of our students in mind. However, as the concept was initially affiliated with disability studies, it could imply that second language students have a a deficit to overcome, an implication in opposition to a "difference-as-resource" perspective (Canagarajah, 2002, p. 13) and a valuing of linguistic diversity. [page 191]

While there might be some points to make about how UDL doesn't explicitly allow for multiple languages to be used, the mere fact that it came from disability studies does not, in my opinion, does not imply any deficit. This is similar to the "[Curb-Cut Effect](https://uxdesign.cc/the-curb-cut-effect-universal-design-b4e3d7da73f5)" 

> The assumption of a monolingual English classroom can result in students not receiving support with sentence-level issues and/or it can result in what Carol Severino (1993) has called an "assimilationist" approach in which faculty expect English language learners to aim for written texts undistinguishable from those by native English speakers. The concept of a "written accent" (Zawacki et al., 2007) that parallels the spoken accents to prevalent at our institution has been helpful for faculty in understanding that linguistic difference does not always mean that an error has been made. [page 195--196]

> they distinguish between what Ferris (2011) has termed "treatable" or rule-governed errors and "untreatable" ones that are "idiosyncratic" and not rule-governed, such as word choice (p. 36). [page 196]

> instructors noted benefits from focusing on patterns of error as opposed to individual "mistakes." In practical application, a number of faculty began asking students to "chart and keep track of their errors," to "identify patterns, marking them in different colors." [page 196]

> Understanding concepts such as "ear learner" and "eye learner" (Reid, 2006) and the different L2 writer subgroups (international, late-arriving, and early-arriving resident immigrants) (Ferris, 2009), for example, helps instructors better relate to their students and to the knowledge that they bring into the classroom. [page 196--197]

> a number of faculty now assign a literacy narrative project that encourages students to reflect on their language histories and to read the world of multilingual writers. [page 198]

> A full-time faculty member added an international component to a visual analysis assignment, explaining the benefits of asking students to select advertisements for analysis from their home country. By doing this, he intends to make the students "more comfortable" but also, for the class as a whole, to highlight writing for "multilingual audiences." [page 198]

> Through the grant, we offered part-time faculty stipends of $150 to either attend three face-to-face workshops or to complete five online training modules. Yet, even with the stipends, participation by part-time faculty was lower than we expected. While the online modules were developed specifically with the goal of involving busy part-time faculty in training, only 32% completed five of the modules. It is possible that larger stipends could have led to more participation. However, what we have argued is the need not just for stipends but for conversion of part-time lines to full-time lines. The working conditions of many of our part-time faculty made investment in this professional development and curricular change difficult, if not impossible, even when training is offered online. [page 199]

> We also introduced a writing faculty listserv where faculty often discuss both theory and classroom practice. For us, having spaces for all faculty to share their new ideas encouraged collaboration, avoided a top-down approach to project goals, and generated a plethora of ideas and enthusiasm. [page 200]
