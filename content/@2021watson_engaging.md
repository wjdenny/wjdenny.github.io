# Engaging (the Politics of) Language Difference in the Writing Classroom

## Notes
[[Missy Watson]] is the author.

> we shouldn't be surprised by how deeply ingrained standardized practices are within students' writing practices nor by their distrust in taking risks in educational contexts. (page 58--59)

[[Many students have their own beliefs about language purity and may be resistant to invitations to use multiple languages in an activity]]

[[It's important to consider students' attitudes towards independent styles of learning before implementing them in the classroom]]

> We're centuries deep in a society whose culture and institutions perpetuate standard language ideology-- the belief that one version of English is superior and all other varieties, and their speakers, inferior-- and penalize those who defy it (consciously or not). (page 59)

> not enough for him to simply *decide* to reinsert language practices that he had long learned to silence. (page 59)

> rework his deeply seated language ideologies and English-only practices. (page 59)

> is not sufficient to simply acknowledge, invite, value, and generously respond to language difference. We must further work with students at the *ideological* level to critically examine the beliefs, learned habits, and systems that shut down and aim to eradicate linguistic diversity in the first place. (page 59)

How can we lead students through this kind of transformation?

> Most of us in the United States have been conditioned to trust and uphold monolinguist ideologies. That is, we've been implicitly and explicitly taught in education, the media, and in U.S. culture writ large to assume notions about language such as the following: that an English-only education and society is normal, possible, and ideal; that so-called Standard English is superior; that our students are already functioning as English monolinguals; and, that languages already are and should remain uniform, unchanging, and kept separate from each other. (page 59)

> Monolingualist ideologies-- which shape our daily language choices, communicative biases, and teaching approaches-- gain their power, in part, because they are multifaceted, unquestioned, and, thus, difficult to detect ([[2012 Canagarajah|Canagarajah, 2012]]; [[2007 Horner & Lu|Horner & Lu, 2007]]; [[2018 Watson & Shapiro|Watson & Shapiro, 2018]]). (page 59)

> "Standard English" is not naturally or neutrally standard-- it's *standardized.* (page 59)

> No language or dialect is inherently more standard than another. Instead, historically, linguistic varieties associated with groups of power were deemed (by those very groups) as standard and superior. (page 59)

> But as countless linguistics, educators, and compositionists have asserted for more than half a century, the very monolingualist ideologies that lead us to deem one language variety as superior manifest in ways that maintain national, linguistic, and racial hierarchies and that, thus, cause real harm to people, particularly people of color and those who use minoritized languages. (page 59--60)

> When people are taught to believe certain languages or dialects, such as World Englishes, "accented" Englishes, or nonstandardized Englishes (like African American English), are improper, unclear, inadequate, inferior, or inappropriate, they are also implicitly taught to deem speakers of those language varieties in the same way. (page 60)

> It is thus no coincidence that the people in the United States who are oppressed along the lines of class, race, and national origin are typically also oppressed linguistically, while those who are most privileged (native-English speaking middle- and upper-class White people) stand to gain the most from monolingualist ideologies. (page 60)

[[People who have the most access to privilege benefit the most from monolingual ideologies]]

> also face family and other interpersonal conflict if they use (or decline to use) the White standardized variety, and such conflict may harm the sense of self of these individuals and of entire communities. (page 60)

> They may face grade penalties and may have to spend more labor, time, and money on remedial courses. (page 60)

> no surprise that most U.S. college students do not merely *expect* that they'll continue mastering "SE;" they also often make clear that they *prefer* to. Given the potential consequences listed above, students have good reason to persist in emulating what they perceive as "SE." And teachers likewise have good reason to avoid pushing too hard for visible manifestations of code-meshing and other deviations to "SE" given students' preferences and worries, as well, given the risks of fetishizing, depoliticizing, and stereotyping language differences ([[2019 Horner & Alvarez|Horner & Alvarez, 2019]]; [[2017 Lee|Lee, 2017]]; [[2013 Milson-Whyte|Milson-Whyte, 2013]]). (page 60)
> 
> We do not as often make explicit to students the *oppressive* politics of "SE," nor our role in maintaining them-- that is, we do not often acknowledge, much less discuss, with students the long history of racial oppression via linguistic oppression and how those legacies live on in our very classrooms. (page 60--61)

> If we don't invite FYC students to grapple with all sides of this "SE" coin, we are denying students a more transparent account of the fuller politics of our linguistic choices and thus limiting the sort of critical language awareness that might better invite cross-language practices in academic spaces. (page 61)

> As I argue below, only through a multipronged approach--an array of explicit and carefully crafted strategies across curriculum design, classroom approaches, and engagement with student writing-- will we more fully achieve ideals for making the composition classroom a space that cultivates plurilingual practices and dispositions. (page 61)

> An explosion of scholarship theorizing translingual approaches has emerged over the last ten years (e.g., [[2019 Ayash|Ayash, 2019]]; [[2012 Canagarajah|Canagarajah, 2012]]; [[Canagarajah (2013a)|Canagarajah, 2013a]]; [[2017 Horner & Tetreault|Horner & Tetreault, 2017]]; [[2021 Kiernan, Frost, & Blum Malley|Kiernan, Frost, & Blum Malley, 2021]]; [[2017 Lee|Lee, 2017]]). (page 61)

> problematically equated to uncritical attempts to force students to code-mesh in their writing ([[2018 Schreiber & Watson|Schreiber & Watson, 2018]]). (page 61)

> translingual pedagogy, for me, is much broader: It is informed by best practices across fields, and it invites far more student agency, critical negotiation, ideological work, and, thus, a more multifaceted approach. (page 62)

[[Translingualism is considered more broad than plurilingualism and includes concepts of agency and critical ideological analysis]]

> a major focus is on students learning about, examining, and contesting monolingualist ideologies. Students further gain practice critically negotiating the linguistic and rhetorical choices they make, keeping in mind what linguistic ideologies their audiences may hold and what political and oppressive forces are at play, and then determining for themselves how they wish to proceed. (page 62)

> I'm compelled by research in second language acquisition showing that learners will acquire language more effectively when their affective filters-- those emotions and beliefs that can hamper a sense of security and, thus, risk-taking-- are lowered ([[1982 Krashen|Krashen, 1982]]). (page 62)

[[People acquire language better when their affective filters are not interfering]]

> **When I first began teaching composition, I took an authoritative stance and built a professional and rigorous atmosphere. How could I expect to lower affective filters that way? While I wouldn't claim to have perfected this, I now aim to take a loving stance (yes, a *loving* stance) and build a safe and compassionate atmosphere instead. I ==treat students and their languages as people and practices to love and support rather than to teach and assess.==** (page 62) ^4a0a36

[[An asset-based mindset views students as people to support rather than objects to measure.]]

> Part and parcel of shaping a warm and welcoming atmosphere is building a community. I carve out quite a bit of time for students to get to know each other-- by making students' language and literacy part of the course discussion and the course content and by drawing heavily on icebreakers and peer collaboration. (page 62)
> 
> I distribute a questionnaire on students' language, literacy, and educational backgrounds, and I invite in-class and one-on-one conversation about those differences. For instance, my questionnaire asks students to describe how they use language and literacy outside of school, and most of my students share incredibly sophisticated, creative, and cross-linguistic approaches. However, in the section asking for their strengths in language and literacy, most write they have few or none. I raise this paradox with them: that students are using language and literacy dynamically and expertly, yet they view themselves as only having deficits. My aim here is to begin **dispelling the notion that our language differences are deficits**. (page 63)

> I myself also draw on a fuller linguistic repertoire to put my translingual money where my mouth is, and I offer repeated encouragement for students to feel welcome to likewise draw on their diverse linguistic repertoires in our class. (page 63)

> While I am usually one of a few English monolinguals in the classroom, I draw on my working-class linguistic roots (tones, verbs, and diction I had spent years trying to keep out of my teaching), and I share my own experiences struggling to learn Spanish after years of trying. (page 63)

> Here are two of the CLOs I include in my FYC courses (which I further discuss in [[2018 Watson & Shapiro|Watson & Shapiro, 2018]]; see also [[2019 Mihut|Mihut, 2019]]):
> - Students will examine how attitudes towards linguistic standards empower and oppress language users.
> - Students will acknowledge their and others' range of linguistic differences as resources and draw on those resources to develop rhetorical sensibility.  (page 63--64)

> It's also worth pointing out the importance of using language-ambiguous and practice-based SLOs like "Students will develop strategies for reading, drafting, revising, and editing," rather than standard-focused and achievement-based CLOs like "Students will demonstrate proficiency in Standard Academic English and control over errors, sentence structure, and spelling." (page 64)

We have those standards-based SLOs in [[ELA]], and I cannot remove them. However, I can either choose not to enforce them or enforce the weakest interpretation of them.

> CLOs that make room for linguistic difference also just better represent what researchers across fields have come to know about the nature of language and literacy learning and about the problems behind assuming it's reasonable and ethical to expect students to achieve "mastery" of "SE," (page 64)

> "Language Policy"
> Students are expected to take an active role in developing their writing and language. I recognize that students come from different educational, linguistic, and racial backgrounds and that it takes several years, not a semester, to develop English academic language uses, especially if English is a student's additional (and not first) language. As your instructor, I am committed to adopting approaches deemed most effective by the fields of second language writing and composition and rhetoric: I will provide ongoing feedback on your writing to highlight potential areas to revise/develop (including language uses), and I will refrain from penalizing you for your language. (page 64)

> I consider the use of grading contracts (GCs) to be a more racially just approach than traditional quality-based grading systems ([[Resources/Articles/Inoue (2015)|Inoue, 2015]], [[@2022inoue_labor|2019]]). (page 65)

> My focus when reading and responding to their assignments, then, rests solely on providing feedback, not assessing. (page 65)

> GCs thus help me avoid "calculating" and "defending" grades and "ranking" students against each other, so that I can instead focus on the writer and their development as a writer. (page 65)

> It also (usefully) puts more weight on peer-to-peer feedback since any person's feedback to improve writing becomes important not just the teacher's feedback which in traditional models holds more weight since it's attached to a grade. (page 66)

> I assign texts like Amy Tan's "Mother Tongue" and Safwat Saleem's "Why I Keep Speaking Up Even When People Mock My Accent" (see a list of other prospective readings at <http://tinyurl.com/politicsoflanguage>). (page 66)

> Such a criticism is based on differing assumptions about the place of politics in pedagogy, a contentious pedagogical issue that has long been debated (e.g., [[2001 Benesch|Benesch, 2001]]; [[1990 Hairston|Hairston, 1990]]; [[2001 Santos|Santos, 2001]]; [[1990 Trimbur|Trimbur, 1990]]). (page 68)

> One argument is that teaching should be absent of politics. However, it is my position that all teaching is political and that emphasizing with students the politics behind their language work is actually *less* politically charged and problematic than ignoring or evading the undeniable reality of these politics and, thus, instead uncritically enforcing "SE" and perpetuating false beliefs about its superiority. (page 68)

> First, I work to teach language in the context of student writing. Like a lot of new teachers of writing, I began my teaching career thinking that teaching grammar explicitly (through a whole curriculum of lessons, drills, and testing) was the most conducive to student learning, and I held students accountable by penalizing their grades based on whatever errors persisted. (page 69)

> language is better acquired through ongoing practice and in the context of meaning making, not through decontextualized drills ([[@2010duff_language|Duff, 2010]]; [[1992 Gee|Gee, 1992]]; [[2007 Lantolf|Lantolf, 2007]]; [[1982 Krashen|Krashen, 1982]]); that academic language takes seven or more years to develop, not a few semesters ([[1989 Collier|Collier, 1989]]); that not all errors associated with English language learning are "treatable" and will thus persist or will fade away only over time ([[@2011ferris_treatment|Ferris, 2011]]); and that penalizing multilingual students for even "treatable" errors can be unethical given the time it takes to develop language and to apply grammatical knowledge in writing ([[2012 Matsuda|Matsuda, 2012]]). (page 69)

[[Acquiring language through communication is superior to isolated drills]]

 > issues of language or grammar did not affect the grades I assigned to my students' papers. "Standards" and "errors" aren't ignored (which I'll talk about next), but given my language policy and use of grading contracts, they aren't policed or penalized either. Instead, I follow best practices in composition and SLW by problematizing "proofreading" approaches and by aiming to effectively balance feedback on lower- and higher-order concerns (e.g., [[2004 Myers|Myers, 2004]]). (page 69)
 
 This makes sense only because it's not one of the CLOs of Watsons' course. If I had the power to remove grammar CLOs, I could do that. Though, there might be quite a bit of wiggle room in the way the CLOs are written for L2 ELA Reading and Writing; in that, I think it only specifies that students need to narrate the past. They could do that using at least a few different grammatical constructs. 
 
> rather than use my feedback to push for one way of writing, I instead encourage students to carefully consider and negotiate the language choices they prefer given their writing and meaning-making goals. We thus do not gauge success based on whether they've met or deviated from standards. This calls for treating deviations to "SE" as sites of inquiry and asks teachers to avoid jumping too quickly to assuming such deviations are even " errors" and/or are unwanted ([[Horner, et al. (2011)|Horner, et al., 2011]]). (page 69--70)

I want to read more about how this inquiry is done, especially with respect to early grammar structures.

> academic appropriacy argument "In academic writing, we're expected to do this." (page 70)

> opportunities for students to observe in their own linguistic choices how standard language ideology influences their assumptions about correctness and effectiveness. For example, when it comes to discussing with students how and why to make linguistic choices, I aim to contextualize the politics of their decisions. I adapt an approach described in [[Shapiro, et al. (2016)|Shapiro, Cox, Shuck, and Simnitt (2016)]] wherein students, their peers, and I recursively work to "Notice that an action needs to be taken," "Be aware of the available options and existing constraints of the action," and, "Act, knowing available options and constraints with a degree of control over outcome" (p. 34). (page 70)

^ff05b0

[[There are three steps in working with student writing; noticing, awareness of options, and action]]

> similar to the approach taken by translingual scholars who advocate for substantial time spent negotiating language choices together (see especially [[Canagarajah (2013b)|Canagarajah, 2013b]]; [[2013 Stanley|Stanley, 2013]]). (page 70)

> I constitently fall short of my ideals when enacting each of the strategies I've so far discussed, especially when it comes to shaking off my learned habit of noticing, marking, and editing "errors" (I address this challenge in [[Gonzales Howell, et al. (2020)|Gonzales Howell, Navickas, Shapiro, Shapiro, & Watson (2020)]]. (page 71)

> one major challenge is time. Such a negotiated approach to feedback takes significantly more time than just marking a few recurring errors. Nevertheless, I do what I can do carve out some time for this process. (page 71)

> Third, there is a rich body of scholarship growing in translingualism on the use of translation assignments that draw on students' different dialects/languages that have students team up with speakers of other languages (in the United States) and sometimes internationally) for the purposes of building cross-language skills and collaborations (e.g., [[2016 Horner & Tetreault|Horner & Tetreault, 2016]]; [[2016 Kiernan, Meier, & Wang|Kiernan, Meier, & Wang, 2016]]) (page 72)

> This work not only provides opportunities for building cross-language practices, but also helps to cultivate translingual dispositions wherein language differences are viewed as assets, not deficits. (page 72)
