## Notes
[[Being able to tell a story with data is a skill that needs to be learned and does not come naturally to those who work with data]] This book is a design guide that leads through examples, both good and bad.

[[Data presented with clear visualization and narrative communicates actionable insights more effectively]] 

[[Exploratory and explanatory are two types of data analysis]]

[[Basic visual design principles facilitate understanding data charts]]

[[Good communication should have multiple intermediate levels of detail]] 

[[Basic visual design principles facilitate understanding data charts]]

[[Pie charts are useless]]

[[Horizontal bar charts are easier to read than vertical ones]]

[[Avoid charts with multiple axes]] 

[[Heavy borders on tables distract from the data]]

[[Tables can be easily formatted as heat maps to use color saturation to guide the eye]]

[[One strategy to design clean visuals is to take everything away and only add back what is necessary]]

[[A slopegraph is similar to a line graph, but each category would have its own row]] [Google Images search for "slopegraph"](https://www.google.com/search?q=slopegraph&client=firefox-b-1-d&sxsrf=ALiCzsYQdkS7FFO8i_-Jcmre8fqWTmIytw:1670271053880&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiwiuHGpOP7AhWEIDQIHQIPBCMQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=1366&bih=615&dpr=1)

[[A square area graph visualizes data points as little squares in a larger square pattern, highlighted with different colors]] [Google Images search for "square area graph"](https://www.google.com/search?q=square+area+graph&client=firefox-b-1-d&sxsrf=ALiCzsZfWI_sS81xyuUX5U0DnTbFRutSSQ:1670271152285&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjPodf1pOP7AhUtIjQIHcZLAS8Q_AUoAXoECAIQAw&biw=1366&bih=615&dpr=1)

[[Keep the number of elements in a graph to less than 4 to avoid cognitive overload]]

[[The London Underground Tube map is a good example of many design principles]]

### Use text to drive the point home
So there's all of this information about visual elements, but what about text? [[Headers, chart titles, and slide titles should be direct and to the point]]  For example, I could have called this section simply "Text," but chose instead to present the point up front. 

[[Narrative structure commonly has three parts, or acts]] 

We can apply narrative structure to our presentations, and I think it could help with my teaching role as well.

#### The Setup
Ask yourself the following questions to help make sure you have enough context
- When and where does this story take place?
- Who is the main character, who is driving the action?
- What is the problem?
- Why is it a problem?
- How will you bring about the changes?
