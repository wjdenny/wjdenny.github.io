## Notes
> resident immigrant and multilingual writers are significantly underrepresented in higher-education (Kanno & Harklau, 2012; Ornelas & Solorzano, 2004; Razfar & Simon, 2011) [page 1]

[[Linguistic minority students are often not as visible as other groups]]

> In previous work (e.g., Ortmeier-Hooper & Enright, 2011; Ruecker, 2014), we have argued for the need for L1 and L2 college writing specialists to pay attention to what happens before college, basing this argument in the ethical responsibility to facilitate student success as well as more pragmatic concerns such as knowing the skills students bring to writing classrooms and answering the concerns of external bodies like legislatures and accreditation agencies.  [page 2]

[[Scholars have argued for the importance of understanding the secondary to post-secondary transition of linguistic minority students]]

> In higher education, resident ML students can remain anonymous, unmarked by the TOEFL exam scores that identify international multilingual students. Resident ML students do not generate the tuition dollars or publicity that are often associated with the growing number of international students studying in U.S. higher education.  [page 2]

Are they still growing? Trump and COVID have hit those numbers pretty hard.

[[Linguistic minority students are often not as visible as other groups]]

> we see more instances of higher education institutions being called upon to raise retention and graduate rate. Resident ML writers reside in *these*discussions and data, and L1 and L2 writing researchers should be prepared to be called upon and respond as these conversations unfold. [page 2]

[[Ortmeier and Ruecker call on writing researchers to be prepared to respond to discussions that involve linguistic minority students]]

> our collection follows the pathway forged by Kanno and Harklau (2012) and others (e.g., Blanton, 2005; Hirano, 2014) [page 2--3]

[[Kanno and Harklau paved the way for new research on the success and challeneges of linguistic minority students]]

> often writing serves as one of the conditions that can impede or facilitate school-age multilingual writers' advancement into college-level academic tracks, guidance, and assistance (Blanton, 2005; Enright, 2006; Fu, 1995; Ortmeier-Hopper, 2013). [page 3]

[[Of all of the linguistic skills, writing has the biggest impact on students' acceptance into mainstream college courses]]

> The numbers of English language learners and linguistic minority students moving into post-secondary degree programs remains low, despite the fact that the numbers of U.S. high school students attending college continues to grow (U.S. Bureau of Labor, 2014). Only about 18% of English language learners make it to four-year colleges, and "roughly half of English learners never participate in any type of post-secondary education" (Kanno & Harklau, 2012). As Kanno and Cromley (2013) noted, "higher education, especially 4-year college education, is the pinnacle of [a] system of unequal power distribution" (p. 93). [page 3]

[[Less than a quarter of linguistic minority students transition from high school to a 4-year college]]

> a recent comparative study of college and non-college graduates found that "on virtually every measure of economic well-being and career attainment--from personal earnings to job satisfaction to the share employed full time-- young college graduates are outperforming their peers with less education. (Pew, 2014) Clearly, there are economic and social costs for individuals, employers, and communities when large numbers of U.S. resident and immigrant multilingual students do not reach higher education. [page 4]

> Spack (1997), one of the early researchers in second language writing, once wrote: "[Second language] writers are remarkably diverse, and thus no one label can accurately capture their heterogeneity" (p. 765). Like Spack, we recognize that labeling students can be a "hazardous enterprise" and that such labels place us as teachers and authors "in the powerful position of rhetorically constructing their identities" (Spack, 1997, p. 765).  [page 4]

[[It is a challenge to categorize linguistic minority students]]

> many scholars in this area now discuss students as bilingual or multilingual (ML) writers, acknowledging that they may have literacy experiences in two or more languages. In research studies situated in higher education and applied linguistics, these students can also be discussed as "linguistic minorities," which Kanno and Harklau (2012) defined as those students who speak a language other than English at home. In K--12 contexts, we often read about these students as "English language learners (ELLs)" and "limited English proficient (LEP)." [page 4--5]

^4f1342

The term bilingual or multilingual became common as a way to center the assets that linguistic minority students bring to the classroom.

The term linguistic minority is used in higher education and applied linguistic contexts to describe students who speak a language other than English at home in English-dominant societies.

Terms such as English language learners (ELLs) and limited English proficient (LEP) are commonly used in K-12 education but focus primarily on the deficits of students.

> authors in this collection writing from K-12 perspectives may use the term *English language learner* (*ELL*). [page 5]

> all terms "mask the complexity" of these students, their language backgrounds, and their identities (Cox, Jordan, Schwartz, & Ortmeier-Hooper, 2010) [page 5]

^93a770

[[None of the terms used to describe linguistic minority students can adequately describe the range of identities and backgrounds these students have]]

> the numbers of immigrant and multilingual writers continues to grow, even in rural areas (e.g., Bustamante, Brown, & Irby, 2010; Passel, Cohn, & Hugo Lopez, 2011; see Ruecker, this volume). Similar trends exist in parts of Canada and other English-dominant countries (see Wilson and Kiernan in this volume for discussions on immigrant ML youth in Canada). [page 6]

^9626a5

[[The increasing numbers of immigrants is not limited to major metropolitan areas, but is also increasing in smaller towns and rural areas as well]]

> as in the United States, multilingual immigrant children are the fastest-growing demographic sector in Canadian primary and secondary schools (Milnes & Cheng, 2009; Queen's University, 2010).

^612f07

[[Population of linguistic minority students in K-12 is also growing fast in Canada]]

> the College Assistance Migrant Program (CAMP) ... financial assistance, a learning community, required tutoring, and other activities throughout [...] first year. [page 6]

What is CAMP? Sounds a bit like TRIO.

> Often such studies [on first-generation and minority students] focus on socioeconomic backgrounds, race, and ethnicity; rarely do such studies consider linguistic backgrounds and literacy, and ELLs are often not considered as a separate group for analysis. As a result, Kanno and Cromley (2013) reported that little is known about ELLs college-going patterns. Studies on English learners and language minority students reaching higher education offer some sobering statistics about the plight of these ML writers: only 12% of English language learners and 25% of language minority students completed bachelors' degrees within eight years after high school graduation (Kanno & Harklau, 2012). [page 6]

> What No Child Left Behind (NCLB) and other education policies often fail to acknowledge in their definitions of ELLs are the vast number of factors that impact the level of their writing proficiency and how their secondary writing experiences impact their expectations for college. [page 7]

[[Non-linguistic interference to education is not addressed in federal policies]]

> As Yancey, Robertson, and Taczak (2014) have noted in their work on transfer from high school to college, "students do bring to college what the school culture has emphasized" and "prior knowledge influences new knowledge" (p. 12). [page 7]
> ...
> there is a pronounced level of variability in the kinds of experiences that resident ML students encounter across different U.S. schools, geographic regions, school districts, states, and individual teachers' classrooms. State funding, teacher preparedness, student preparedness, external student support systems, school climate, socioeconomic factors, city/town demographics, class size, school performance/annual yearly progress (AYP), etc. all play a role in the kinds of academic and literacy experiences that ELLs have in the high school contexts (Ortmeier-Hooper & Enright, 2011; Ruecker, 2015). [page 7]

^831a7b

[[Linguistic minority students' education backgrounds vary widely even if they attended local high schools]]

It would stand to reason, then, that [[Prior educational experiences vary even more widely for linguistic minority students that moved to the United States as adults]] ^bb20d7

> Of all four language skills (reading, listening, speaking, and writing), writing is often the most difficult for adolescent MLs. Research on second language acquisition suggests that academic literacy skills, which include academic writing, can take five to seven years to master, if not longer (e.g., Cummins, 1981). [page 7--8]

^066f92

[[Academic literacy for non-native speakers is estimated to take at least five years to truly master.]] and few, if any, EAP programs give that much time before entering mainstream courses.

> The difficulty of writing in a second language, witnessed by my many teachers, coupled with traditional pedagogical perspectives on English language development, has meant that much of ML students' learning experiences in U.S. classrooms have focused on reading, listening, and speaking over writing (Harklai, 1994a; Larsen, 2013). [page 8]
> 
> The rationale for emphasis on speaking, reading, and listening often heard from teachers is that ELL students could not write extensively without extensive foundational knowledge in phonetics, vocabulary, reading, grammar, and sentence structures (Harklau, 1994a). Although current research dispels these myths, this "writing-last" teaching approach continues to be a strong undercurrent in the education of many English language learners and resident bilinguals in U.S. schools. For many ELL writers, the result is that writing practice and instruction is often limited to sentence writing, paragraphs, and grammatical worksheets with the promise that once they master these, they will be allowed to write more (Enright, 2010; Fu, 1995, 2009; Harklau, 1994a; Ortmeier-Hooper, 2013). [page 8]

^72e7a8

[[Many developmental English language classrooms de-emphasize writing in favor of other language skills.]]

> **A narrowing curriculum for ML students.**  Although language acquisition and literacy experts like Snow, Burns, and Griffin (1998) claimed that "being able to read and write in two languages confers numerous intellectual, cultural, economic, and social benefits," educational policies at the federal and local level within the U.S. ended many bilingual and dual language programs by the late 1990s, and even those programs that remained tended to emphasize English proficiency over bilingualism (Fu & Matoush, 2006; Moll, Saez, & Dworin, 2001). Standards movements and national education legislation, like the No Child Left Behind Act, added new complexities (e.g., more state-mandated testing, curricular mandates, and annual yearly progress reports on specific student populations) with far-reaching implications for the education and resident ESL and bilingual students in K-12 schools. Disturbingly, ELLs were largely and afterthought in development of the Common Core, meriting only a brief mention in the Standards (see de Oliveira, this volume, for more on this). [page 8]

^1faa20

In general, [[Language curriculum in educational institutions has shrunk significantly over the past few decades.]]

[[Linguistic minority students seem to be an afterthought in education policy.]] Same thing is happening with Guided Pathways.

> Teacher preparedness also plays a role in the outcomes of resident ML writers in U.S. schools, which may in part stem from disciplinary divisions of labor (see Matsuda, 2006). Few high school teachers in North American are trained to work with second language writers (Ortmeier-Hooper & Enright, 2011). Most ESL teachers are not required to take a course dedicated to teaching second language writing (Larsen, 2013). Even for those teachers who intuitively sense that ML and ELL writers may need additional support and specific pedagogical interventions, the time and planning required for such adjustments can feel daunting and unsupported. As Roberge, Losey, and Wald (2016) note, teachers need concrete curricular ideas and "seek specific strategies, techniques, practices, and activities that go beyond a generic notion of 'good teaching'" (p. 2). [page 8--9]

^65b30f

I believe the requirement for an post-secondary ESL instructor in Iowa is a bachelor's degree in *anything*. Seems fairly common across states, as well. 

[[TRIO ESL]] has been good for providing that ML-specialist support, but in my experience as an ESL specialist tutor, it still has the problem of putting all of that expertise into a small group of specialists rather than in the hands of all student-facing staff.

Providing that ML-specialist training to mainstream faculty could be interesting work.

> ELL students are often placed in lower-level academic tracks when they enter U.S. high schools (Fu, 1995, 2009; Harklau, 1994a; Ortmeier-Hooper, 2010). ELL and bilingual students often find themselves "ghetto-ized" into two types of academic tracks in U.S. schools: (1) ESL courses/tracks, and (2) general/mainstream lower-level academic tracks.
> ...
> the separate classrooms also segregate students from the wider monolingual English-speaking school community. The fallout from segregation is that ELL students are often "invisible" to many mainstream teachers, administrators, guidance counselors, and monolingual students in their schools. [page 9]

> there are a number of other challenges that resident ML students face as they pursue a college education. [page 9]

> poverty, which is a defining characteristic of many resident ML students' lives. For instance, the Pew Research Center (2014) found, in an analysis of the Census American Community Survey, that 66% of ELLs lived in families that were below 200% of the poverty line, a number that was only 37% among non-ELL youths. In part because of the declining buying power of Pell Grants, resident ML students tend to choose community college, where the funding goes further (Fry, 2011; Hassel & Giordano, 2013; Ruecker, 2015). [page 9]

![[Linguistic minority students can be challenged by higher rates of poverty]]

> Work responsibilities ... consequently they are reluctant to take on loans (Ruecker, 2015), preferring to work additional hours to make up for the cost differential. ... work in order to contribute to their family's income ... Working, especially in jobs that are off-campus or unrelated to school/university work-study programs, can lead to documented concerns with lower persistence, difficult work-school balances, and poorer academic achievement among lower-income, linguistic minority secondary and college students (Astin, 1997; Marsh & Kleitman, 2005) [page 9--10]

^6e3af9

[[Linguistic minority students can be challenged by greater working hours.]]

> Family responsibilities. Resident ML students often have a strong connection to family, which can both support and hinder student success. ... the largest population of resident ML students in the United States are Latinos, who often place great importance on the cultural and traditional value of *familismo* (Sy & Romero, 2008; Vega, 1990). Sy & Romero (2008) explained this idea: "In contrast to the values of individuality and independence emphasized in dominant U.S. culture, familismo requires an individual family member to put the needs of the family first, even if it means making personal sacrifices" (p. 214). Such sacrifices include attending a less competitive college closer to home, taking are of siblings, and working extra hours to support the family. [page 10]

^22b6f0

The authors mentioned research on Latino students, but I wonder if similar studies have been done for Sudanese, Congolese, etc.
