## Rhetorical Précis
Hu, Wang, Liao, & Peng, in their article titled "Do Experiences Studying Abroad Promote Dialectical Thinking? Empirical Evidence From Chinese International Students" (2021), argues that Chinese international students' experienced higher degrees of dialectical thinking due to studying abroad. They support their claim by investigating how Chinese students studying abroad in diverse host contexts affects their tolerance for contradiction. Their purpose is to provide novel research to uncover how multicultural experiences affect peoples' psychology. They adopt an empirical tone for the readers of Frontiers in Psychology and others interested in the topic of international education, dialectical thinking, and cultural psychology.

## Notes
> Open Doors Data from the Institute of International Education, China has become the leading source of international students in Western countries (IIE, 2020). For example, international students from China account for 42% of all international students in United States universities and colleges (IIE, 2020). [page 1] #topic/education/international

> prior work also argues that experiences studying abroad should exert profound psychological impacts on International students' academic life, social life, and their personality development (Zimmermann and Neyer, 2013; Gieser, 2015). For instance, evidence suggests studying abroad experiences exert positive influences on extraversion, openness, and agreeableness, and negative influence on neuroticism (Zimmermann and Neyer, 2013). Moreover, studying abroad programs enhance college students' foreign language learning and cultural adaptation self-efficacy (Milstein, 2005; Cubillos and Ilvento, 2012).

> Cultural psychologists contend that the impacts of individuals' multicultural experiences on their mental processes and behavioral patterns are mixed, paradoxical, and even seemingly contradictory (Hu et al., 2021). Past work suggests that the breadth and depth of multicultural experiences promote creativity (Leung et al., 2008), cognitive flexibility (Ritter et al., 2012), large-scale cooperation (Buchan et al., 2009), generalized trust (Cao et al., 2014), etc. However, multicultural experiences may also lead to greater outgroup prejudice (Sparkman et al., 2016), unethical behavior (Lu et al., 2017) and even exacerbate clashes of civilizations (Huntington, 1997).

> Since the two renowned cultural] psychologists Peng and Nisbett (1999) put forward the concept of dialectical thinking in a highly influential article published in the American Psychologist two decades ago, a large body of work that has been done to further this line of research (Ma-Kellams et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2016; Spencer-Rodgers et al., 2018). Nisbett et al. (2001) contend that dialectical thinking contained in Eastern culture is not equivalent to the dialectic of Hegel and Marx in Western philosophy. Dialectical thinking is a cognitive style or cognitive frame, which contains a series of closely linked cognitive processes (Spencer-Rodgers et al., 2018). Dialectical thinking represents the ideological tradition based on Eastern philosophy, especially the lay epistemology of Taoism (Spencer-Rodgers et al., 2018). [page 2] #topic/dialectical-thinking

> Dialectical thinking consists of three core principles: principle of change (i.e., reality is a dynamic process), principle of contradiction (i.e., contradictory things can exist simultaneously), and principle of holism (i.e., everything is interrelated) (Spencer-Rodgers et al., 2018). First, the expectation of change means that East Asians believe that all phenomena and events in the world change in a cyclical manner, so the expectation of change is inevitable (Spencer-Rodgers et al., 2018). However, Westerners' expectations of change tend to be stable or linear, either gradually increasing or decreasing (Spencer-Rodgers et al., 2018). Second, tolerance for contradictions means that East Asians consider contradiction to be a natural, intrinsic, and unavoidable feature of all beings. Therefore, East Asians can accept phenomena that seem to be contradictory, and do not need to resolve them. East Asians prefer moderation or compromise, which is similar to the golden thought advocated by Confucian culture (Spencer-Rodgers et al., 2018). However, Westerners reject seemingly contradictory phenomenon, believing that contradiction violates the formal logic proposed by Aristotle (Nisbett et al., 2001), so contradiction must be resolved or integrated. Third, the perception of interconnectedness means that East Asians pay more attention to the relationship between the whole and the parts of things. East Asians believe that all objects, people, systems, and ideas have a permanent relationship (Spencer-Rodgers et al., 2018). However, Westerners pay more attention to the focal object and ignore the specific context of the object (Nisbett et al., 2001). [page 2] #topic/dialectical-thinking #topic/psychology/cultural

> As they have articulated in their article, they asserted that "holistic thinkers tend to engage in reasoning involving contradictions that tolerate opposites, whereas analytic thinkers tend to engage in reasoning involving contradiction that chooses one of two opposing propositions (Peng and Nisbett, 1999; Spencer-Rodgers et al., 2018).

> Drawing upon the dynamic constructivist approach (Hong et al., 2000), it would be interesting to see if multicultural experiences and dialectical thinking dynamically interplay with each other. For instance, would individuals with richer multicultural experiences (e.g., breadth and depth) tend to be more dialectical or less dialectical? Would studying abroad experiences enhance or reduce dialectical thinking? Would priming studying abroad experiences enhance participants' tolerance for contradiction? There are three dimensions within dialectical thinking. Considering that measuring all three tasks altogether would produce confounding effects such as our manipulation is not powerful enough to affect all three tasks or if we do detect the hypothesized effect we cannot make exact casual claims. We therefore only focus on tolerance for contradiction for the current investigation. [page 3] #topic/psychology/cultural

> we infer that when individuals encounter or interact with foreign cultural members, their cognitive flexibility and openness to experiences will likely increase. Thus, their degrees of tolerance for contradictions may be enhanced through increased integrative complexity (Tadmor et al., 2012). Alternatively, cultural identity threats may arise due to foreign cultural inflow induced by recalling studying abroad experiences (Morris et al., 2011), therefore participants' Chinese way of thinking may be enhanced to meet their cultural identity needs.

> Based on previous work (Maddux and Galinsky, 2009), we adapted the multicultural experiences priming paradigm. [page 3]

> Based on the initial measures of dialectical thinking (Peng and Nisbett, 1999), we collected scientific discoveries in the fields of natural sciences, social sciences and humanities in the scientific literature within the last 3 years, and then modified these scientific discoveries into two conflicting scientific statements (see Supplementary Appendix B for all the materials). If participants agree with both scientific statements in two opposing directions which are seemingly contradictory, that means participants deem both viewpoints are plausible and convincing. Lower scores on the differences between the endorsements of the two opposing statements means greater tolerance for contradiction. In the third part, we collected demographic variables. Participants were asked to indicate their gender, age, education level, socioeconomic status, current study abroad country and so forth. [page 3--4]

Wouldn't people's tendency to be agreeable to researchers and maintain the peace be a confound here?

> In other words, when participants were manipulated to mentally stimulate the host culture in which they are currently studying, their degree of tolerance for conflicting viewpoints increased, at least temporarily. More specifically, they reported that two seemingly conflicting statements could co-exist and did not contradict each other. In other words, they reported that the two seemingly conflicting scientific findings were indeed both convincing, F(3,254) = 2.95, p < 0.05 and likeable, F(3,254) = 3.01, p < 0.05 (For subgroup differences please see Figures 1, 2). More specifically, for convincingness, the difference between studying abroad and hometown culture (t = 2.38, p < 0.05), as well as the difference between typical day and hometown culture (t = 2.21, p < 0.05) was significant. [page 4]

> We speculate that it is highly likely that priming typical day for the group of Chinese international students while they are studying abroad is naturally similar to priming their everyday life during studying abroad, which makes this control condition serve an equivalent function of priming studying abroad. Therefore, we deem both conditions as our experimental conditions and treat typical day priming as analogs as studying abroad priming. [page 4]

> Previous work indicates that priming the yin-yang symbol among European Americans lead them to anticipate more changes in judgments and behaviors (Alter and Kwan, 2009). This finding suggests that temporarily priming salient cultural elements could shift participants' dialectical thinking. Our results also indicate that when participants recall their studying abroad experiences in their respective host countries (e.g., United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and Australia, etc.), they are more likely to show greater tolerance of contradiction. [page 4]

> The underlying processes may be partly explained by integrative complexity (Tadmor et al., 2012). Integrative complexity is a particular information-processing style which represents the ability to integrate differing perspectives or establish the conceptual connections among differentiated dimensions (Suedfeld and Bluck, 1993). With richer and deeper foreign experiences, especially in largely distinct cultural contexts, participants would be more likely to encounter multiple perspectives (e.g., Western vs. Eastern cultural traditions), incorporate complex or even competing systems of thought (e.g., holistic vs. analytical thinking), and differing value systems (e.g., individual rights and collective duties). They therefore have to reconcile contradictory viewpoints or even competing thought patterns. These demanding processes may play a role in promoting Chinese international students' greater tolerance of contradiction, which manifested in endorsing competing scientific statements across a variety of domains (i.e., natural sciences, humanities and social sciences). As Chinese international students experience cultural shock, cultural conflict, and cultural integration through the course of cultural adaptation, their cognitive complexity may increase as they become more adept at reconciling competing perspectives and cultural differences. Another possible explanation might be that recalling studying abroad experiences pose cultural identity threats (Morris et al., 2011) which may induce reinforcements of previously existing Chinese way of thinking. Therefore, enhancement of dialectical thinking is a psychological outcome of cultural identity protection. These competing theoretical accounts await future work to validate and explore. [page 5]

> we observed that Chinese international students were more likely to show tolerance for contradiction when they were primed with their host culture rather than primed with their home culture. [page 5--6]
