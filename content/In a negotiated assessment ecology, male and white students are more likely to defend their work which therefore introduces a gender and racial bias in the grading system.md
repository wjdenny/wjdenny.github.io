#statement 

[[Asao Inoue argued for community-based assessment; a system of grading that combines teacher and peer student evaluations using rubrics]] but later made criticisms about its ability to foster a just and equitable classroom. [[Criticisms of community-based assessment include failing to equalize power dynamics, as well as gender and racial biases]].

In a negotiated assessment ecology, male and white students are more likely to defend their work and therefore introduce a gender and racial bias in the grading system. This is most likely due to the fact that they are less likely to experience stereotype threat. [[Stereotype threat is an internalized bias where the person believes a stereotype about their identity to be true]] [[Stereotype threat reduces the efficacy of students because they believe the stereotype to be true even when it is not]] with women and people of color being the most vulnerable. Self-promotion is typically a white and male cultural trait, and [[Students who do not have access to a white racial habitus will not easily understand its rules]]

Because [[Judgements of language quality in any grading contract give rise to Stoddardian dikes; a racialized grading apartheid]] this segregation can develop for any person of a marginalized group that does or can not advocate for themselves.

For these reasons, [[Success in conventional classrooms is synonymous with adopting a white racial habitus]] and [[Hybrid grading contracts still uphold a racialized cultural-linguistic standard because they grade based on the perception of language quality]]
