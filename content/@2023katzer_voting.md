# Fewer Non-English Voting Materials
[[Grace Katzer]] wrote this article for the [[Daily Iowan]].

> [!summary] Summary
> On August 30th, 2023, the Iowa Attorney General's office appealed and overturned a district court ruling that would allow non-English voting materials to be provided to voters despite the Iowa English Language Reaffirmation Act. The result is that over a hundred thousand voters who speak other languages will have increased difficulty in voting and potential legal consequences for failing to vote correctly due to miscommunications.

## Notes
> Spanish speakers in Iowa are likely to be the population greatest affected by Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird's appeal to remove all non-English voting materials in the state. [6A]

> on Aug. 30, overturned a district court's ruling in June that enabled Iowa counties to provide ballots, voter registration form,s and absentee ballot applications for non-English speakers. [6A]

> proponents say Bird's appeal falls under the Iowa English Language Reaffirmation Act, which made English the state's official language and required all official documents to be in English. [6A]

> Gov. Reynolds signed a bill into law in 2021 that reduces the time that Iowans have to vote in an election. [6A]

> Former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack, a democrat, signed the Iowa English Language Reaffirmation Act into law in 2002. In 2003, former Iowa Secretary of State Chester Culver made non-English voter registration forms available to the public, leading to a 2009 injunction that blocked non-English voting materials in Iowa until June 2023. The June ruling overturned the 15-year injunction. [6A]

> According to the State Data Center of Iowa, 128,039 Iowans-- who are 5 years and older-- speak Spanish at home, up 25 percent from 96,793 Iowans in 2010. [6A]

> According to the 2020 census, Iowans who identify as Latino make up 6.9 percent of the state's total population, with 215,986 people self-identifying as Latino in the 2020 census-- a 261 percent increase from 82,473 in 2000. [6A]

> Bird's appeal represents centuries-long systemic racism in the state, [[Lina-Maria Murillo|Murillo]] said, which will impact the constitutional right to vote for an entire population. [6A]

> "It just seems asinine to me that we would only use English as the only language for all government entities across the board," she [[Cara McFerren]] said. "Because if she's going to do it for elections, then you kind of have to do it for everybody. So why is she singling out just elections? [...] for there to be a 'one language only,' when a large portion of our nation is people from other countries that speak other languages, I just don't understand it." [6A]

> [Adam] [[Adam Zabner|Zabner]], a child of Venezuelan immigrants and a fluent Spanish speaker, is one of the first Latino members of the Iowa House. After spending late nights at the Capitol, [[Adam Zabner|Zabner]] recalled one "illustrative moment" that made him proud to be a state legislator. 
> 
> "I was walking down the front steps [of the capitol], and I met a Latino family who spoke Spanish," he said, "They asked me to take a picture of them in front of the Capitol and they asked me, 'Is that building open to the public?'"
> 
> [[Adam Zabner|Zabner]] said the Spanish-speaking family would not have known the Capitol was open to the public because all its signage was in English.
> 
> "They didn't know that they were able to see the basis of power in our state, where our laws are written," he said. "If folks don't even know they're welcome in our Capitol, just to see where the laws are made, that's going to impact politics and policies. [6A]

> The median earnings for Iowa Latinos amounted to $29,330-- the overall median earning for Iowans was $39,068. [6A]

[[Latino workers earn less than the overall population.]]

> [[Miriam Timmer-Hackert]], co-president of the [[League of Women Voters]] of Johnson County, said her number one concern is the legal impact of non-English speakers incorrectly registering to vote. [6A]

> [[Miriam Timmer-Hackert|Timmer-Hackert]] said it will be difficult for non-English speakers to know if it's legal for them to vote. [6A]

> "It's just so heartbreakingly complicated because there are narrow exceptions ... and when minorities get arrested, they are pretty much prohibited from voting," she said. "They're not going to risk getting arrested again just for one vote." 
> According to the Iowa Department of Corrections 2020 racial disparity report, Black inmates made up 25 percent of the prison institution population despite accounting for 4.4 percent of the state population, whereas Hispanic inmates made up 7 percent of the prison population and accounted for 6.8 percent of the state population. [6A]

> In 2020, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis had 20 people arrested for voting illegally in the general election, and multiple people were seemingly unaware they did anything wrong.
> 
> [[Miriam Timmer-Hackert|Timmer-Hackert]] said she is worried something like that will happen in Iowa if people cannot understand the voting materials. 
> 
> "I don't want to sign anyone up to vote illegally, because I'm afraid that Brenna Bird would humiliate them and prosecute them just because they're a minority," she said. "It really is infuriating that she talks about securing election integrity, but it's just a way to keep people who only speak Spanish from voting." [6A]

> "Voting rights and labor rights are interconnected issues," [[Lina-Maria Murillo|Murillo]] said.
> Latinos are often the children of immigrants being raised in this country, and their parents are doing the best they can to make ends meet," she said. "And so, they have to have their children go to work, too."
> 
> Gov. Kim Reynolds signed Senate File 542 into law in May, loosening child labor laws in Iowa. The law allows 14 and 15-year olds to work six hours per day-- until 9 p.m.-- during the school year. During summer months, they are allowed to work until 11 p.,. Sixteen and 17-year-olds can work the same hours as an adult.
> 
> "They don't want those people to vote," Murillo said of Iowa politicians, "And they don't want [them] to vote and because they don't want them to have control over their life, over their labor."  [6A]
