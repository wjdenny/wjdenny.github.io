Similar to how [[Implicit bias is a preference that is not under our conscious control]], and just how [[The first step to managing implicit biases is to reflect on them and to get feedback from other people]] the same can be said for problematizing a habitus. It might stand to reason that implicit bias is a type of, or at least part of the same physiological mechanism as habitus.
