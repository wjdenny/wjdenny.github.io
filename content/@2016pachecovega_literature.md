## Rhetorical Précis
Dr. Pacheco-Vega, in his blog article titled "How to do a literature review", argues that there are three important concepts to understand when it comes to doing a literature review on a topic: concept tracing, concept saturation, and mind-mapping. He supports this claim by explaining what these three concepts are and how they work together. Pacheco-Vega's purpose is to contribute his own workflow to the discussion on doing a literature review in order to help students and research assistants manage their reading workload more effectively. He adopts an informal and professional tone for the readers of his blog and others interested in research and knowledge management.

## Notes
Citation tracing is when you identify important sources in the literature for the topic you are working on. Take note of what these sources cite. 

> Citation tracing refers to the activity wherein we trace which authors cite which work, and the relationships across these cites. For me, citation tracing is fundamental, because it allows me to see whether there is a gap in the literature, and how each author is working through the concepts. For example, I have seen about 4 articles on the human right to water and how to implement it from a policy perspective. None of these articles actually link to the literature on policy implementation. They talk abstractly about policy implementation of the human right to water, but they fail to link to the literature. How did I know this? Because not only did I read the article, but also looked through the reference list. I did not recognize any articles that were specific to the policy implementation literature (a body of works that I know very well given that I teach the omnibus course on public policy theories).

For the example he gave, he noted that none of the sources cited any papers on policy, which shows that there was a gap in the literature of how to translate the research findings into policy. It's not quite clear how this might apply to other types of material, but there may be other tells such as this that I can look for in 
my own research.

Concept saturation is where we begin to see the same sources popping up again and again. In a broad topic, this may never happen, though I have begun to see repeated sources in some of my reading.

I also feel a bit unclear about his use of mind mapping. It seems like he already has well defined categories for his mappings, but students would not have that level of familiarity with the field. I don't understand how students should be expected to have such a high-level overview when they're still trying to read and take notes on articles. Presumably those students are the audience of his blog post.

I should think more about what might work well for me. I have a tendency to read widely rather than deeply, meaning I don't usually follow references but instead find a new article searching by other means. Eventually, I start to notice articles that cite the same sources so there eventually is a sort of convergence approaching "concept saturation" but I don't know if its the same as what he describes.

> Two of my favourite who write specifically about literature reviews are How To Do a Literature Review (written by Aurelie) and Literature Review HeadQuarters (written by Ben – see this helpful post of his on when to say “I already have enough literature, thankyouverymuch“).

He did recommend two scholars for their explanation of these concepts, so those might be worth a look as well.
