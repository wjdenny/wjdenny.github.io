Before taking on statistics, it's a good idea to learn or review [[Algebra]], [[Calculus]], and [[Probability Theory]].

Here is a suggested curriculum for learning statistical methods in language acquisition:
1.  Introduction to statistical analysis: This course will provide an overview of statistical methods, including descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, and hypothesis testing.
2.  Regression analysis: This course will cover regression analysis, including simple linear regression, multiple regression, and logistic regression.
3.  Multivariate analysis: This course will cover multivariate analysis techniques, including factor analysis, principal component analysis, and discriminant analysis.
4.  Longitudinal data analysis: This course will cover techniques for analyzing longitudinal data, including growth curve modeling and mixed-effects modeling.
5.  Advanced topics in statistical analysis: This course will cover advanced topics in statistical analysis, such as structural equation modeling and survival analysis.
6.  Application of statistical methods in language acquisition research: In this course, students will learn how to apply statistical methods to language acquisition research, including the design of studies, data collection, and analysis.

Throughout the curriculum, students will have the opportunity to work on real-world data sets and practice applying statistical methods to language acquisition research.
