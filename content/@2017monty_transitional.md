## Rhetorical Précis
%% Review a [description of rhetorical précis from Cuyamaca College](https://www.cuyamaca.edu/student-support/tutoring-center/files/student-resources/rhetorical-precis-description-and-examples.pdf). %%

%%
[Dr. Pacheco-Vega], in [his blog article] titled "[Triaging your reading workload]" ([2019]), argues that [the ways in which we decide when to read an article in more depth can and should vary by individuals and is best learned by experience]. [He] supports this claim by [providing examples of techniques that work for him but others have claimed are not effective as well as vice versa] and finally [encouraging readers to develop their own guidelines for deciding what merits further reading]. [Pachecho-Vega]'s purpose is to [show how to more effectively process reading workloads] in order to [help students and researchers make better decisions about what to read in more depth]. [He] adopts [an informal tone] for the readers of [his blog] and others interested in the topic of [knowledge management].

## Notes
> In order to more effectively and affectively meet the diverse needs of transitioning students, a contextualized and systemic approach to program design is warranted. [page 202]

> Watkins (1999) argued that the use oif hypertext writing can "emphasize learning as a collective, rather than individual" (p. 393) [page 205]

> Some have framed this mixture of social media and classroom spaces as leading to distraction (Baker, Lusk, & Neuhauser, 2012; Froese et al., 2012), or viewed by students as inauthentic (Meng-Fen, Hoffman, & Borengaser, 2013). Conversely, Junco, Heigerbert, and Loken (2011) have argued that integrating Twitter in the classroom experience "showed that students and faculty were both highly engaged in the learning process in ways that transcended traditional classroom activities" (p. 119), while Hsu, Ching, and Grabowski (2014) found that the contextualized use of microblogging and social media helped develop "a positive sense of community" among students (p. 752). Significantly, the critical use of mobile technology and social media can draw from students' own lived experiences and act as scaffolds upon those experiences in order to inform classroom practices (see also Garcia, 2012; Tessier, 2013). [page 205]

> Phelp's (1989) practice-theory-practice arc, as articulated by Huot (2002):
> 
> > A practitioner starts with a specific practice (the first P) that she is unhappy with. Her goal is to arrive at a practice (the last P in the arc) with which she is more comfortable. However, before she can really change her practice, she must also confront the practice on a theoretical level.

I imagine this practice-theory-practice arc could also apply to other professionals, for example, social workers and therapists.

> The survey study focused on a single English 1302 course section  [page 206]

> Numerous class observations revealed concerns about single-instructor, single-student interactions, an arbitrary limitation that can result in inefficient and inconsistent instruction and assessment (Brunk-Chavez & Fourzan-Rice, 2013). It seemed a perfect storm for teacher burnout and student dependence, and the students who were not seeking out individualized attention were suffering. [page 207]

This is one thing that has always bothered me about classroom teaching. Whereas one-one interaction is not efficient in a classroom but arguably the best for personal development. 

> Green (2012) noted that "students sought assistance from their instructor, their former high school teacher, a public librarian whom they had received helped from before, peers in their class, and/or a sibling. students rarely asked for help from someone based on their position." (p. 95) [page 207]

I wonder how much of this is cultural difference. If students come from a region with high corruption where position and titles do not match skills and training, it would make perfect sense that a more reliable estimate of a person's helpfulness would be their own previous experience.

> In fact, it is quite possible that our multilingual students face two different and related binary identity pressures. They are struggling, as all freshmen, with becoming "college students" who belong in university learning situations. But success for multilingual students is more complicated by the support systems that, in one sense, haunt them. At UTPA, for instance, there are a variety of culturally based initiatives that center on reengaging, privileging, or honoring students' Hispanic backgrounds. While intentions are good, the comparison of home culture to school culture, home language to school language, the classroom to the real world is damn near unavoidable. How can we combat those binary patterns and make identity a more fluid construct in terms of disciplinary or research expertise? Part of the answer lies in creating unavoidable access to people who can make an immediate difference in learning. [page 207--208]

> conference event as a multilingual rhizome (Deleuze & Guattari, 1987; Hagood, 2008), mixing disciplinary discourse communities with student projects on language and learning and setting a stage for understanding our language interactions as rhetorical (rather than as communal or gatekeeping). [page 208]

> face-to-face interactions at CompoCon provided students with opportunities to talk through their writing concerns, a practice that has a positive effect on writing anxiety (Corbett, 2007). [page 208]

> Where there are experts available to help with their research, students experience high levels of fear and anxiety (Mellon, 1986). These feelings hinder students from approaching librarians who are available at a variety of service points to help them navigate the world of university research. Underscoring this hesitancy is the students' belief that they should already know how to use the library. The vast majority of first-year students are transitioning from a one-room school library that can be easily browsed for research materials to a building with hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of books and a complex wayfinding structure. The simultaneous transition to a new space combined with a new set of expectations for conducting college-level work can make the research process overwhelming for many students. [page 208--209]

Similar to their fear of approaching their professors; see: [[@2017wojahn_first#^96ecc8]]

> Instead of being a shadowy figure on the periphery of college research, the librarians were an integral part of the class and negotiated an in-between space as a co-teacher, research mentor, and life coach. These positive and frequent interactions with librarians helped to alleviate the students' anxiety about research (Kwon, 2008). [page 209]

> Students were required to interact via a dedicated course wiki and over the social media network Twitter, while additionally they were invited to utilize tehir own preferred modes and networks as classroom spaces. [page 209]

> The Socially Mediated Classroom was designed to capitalize on emerging scholarly trends by supplementing conventional classroom interactions and augmenting students' lived mobile writing practices with social media and multimodal pedagogies in order to create an equitable and empowering classroom space for multilingual learners (Hsu, Ching, & Grabowski, 2014). [page 209]

How did they train their students to use Twitter?

> Initially, students who were less familiar with the Twitter format (all students reported they had heard of it, although not all were active users) admitted to having feelings of consternation regarding this mode of class interaction, thoughts that reflected Romberger's (2013) warning that student anxiety can be compounded when interactions take place via a digital discourse community. As the semester progressed, however, students began to more naturally integrate social media and mobile use into the everyday of their coursework to, among other tasks, send private messages and email, disseminate public messages, share content with classmates, geotag themselves and peers participating in events like small group meetings and CompoCon, and upload content to hybrid spaces-- all of which are activities that "count" as writing (Wolff, 2013). [page 210]

> Students stayed in constant contact with their instructor throughout the day via their traditional (email) and emergent (Twitter direct messaging) modes, while automated email notifications of wiki updates and geotagging allowed students to passively and actively remind their peers that classwork was being done. ... students introduced mobile social applications like Vine, Instagram, and Snapchat to build community, share content, compose invention drafts of their research methodologies, and expand classroom space. [page 210]

> During CompoCon, students composed selfies with their professional collaborators, at once recording their participation and tacitly announcing their equal place within the scholarly community. Recalling what Lasorsa, Lewis, and Holton (2012) described as "omnipresent, often fragmented, and a collective effort involving the audience," students reported that these types of social media interactions led to reduced fear and increased confidence in their work (p. 20). [page 210]

> [multilingual writing students] are more likely to use mobile devices when compared to other groups (Lee, Elkasabi, & Streja, 2012), but their reasons for adoption and rates of use are varied (Ruecker, 2012). [page 211]

> Naydan (2013) noted that students' multiliteracy "exists in everyday reality and by default" and that the expectation of this expertise is "[[The concept of always-already, or immer schon refers to an action or state that has continued without any known beginning|always already]] present in the twenty-first century" (p. 1). [page 211--212]

> contrary to instructors' awareness of students' increasing digital literacies as well as the modes used to practice those literacies, *less than 1%* of higher education faculty incorporated social media into their classes or assignments (Meng-Fen, Hoffman, & Borengasser, 2013). [page 212]

> The important element to an accessible and sustainable event is that it happens when students are available-- during class time. Both our embedded libraries and out conference series, not to mention the amount of online interactions in the mediated classroom, depended on in-class integration. Learning better processes requires enactment and additive events that bring more voices to the mix and more opportunities for feedback, both to mirror our multilingual students' realities and foreground the need to become more fluid at rhetorical language awareness, use, and practice on real audiences.
