The first step to managing implicit biases is to reflect on them and to get feedback from other people. When implicit biases are discovered, you have the opportunity to shed light on that thought pattern and change it. These biases are like habits, or well-worn neural pathways that guide our behavior without being aware of them. [[Techniques such as anonymous grading, grading contracts, clarifications, and an asset-based mindset can help reduce bias]] [[Having empathy for students is the real key to reducing bias]]
