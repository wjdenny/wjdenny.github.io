Language is a cultural artifact.

Language, like culture, exists primarily within communities primarily and individuals secondarily. Languages and their dialects are often strongly associated with the people who speak them[^1]. People can learn additional languages and forget old ones, but the language will continue to be used elsewhere in other communities. Through code-switching and plurilingualism, people effortlessly negotiate the language and dialect with the people they are communicating with.

Languages can die, also, and one of the ways that can happen is when the utility of the language begins to wane. Perhaps this suggests that a habitus can also die when its utility  no longer serves people. This might happen when the habitus loses its ability to express cultural capital, or when it no longer serves to facilitate trust and allegiance between members who share similar a habitus.
