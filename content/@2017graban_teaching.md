## Rhetorical Précis
%% Review a [description of rhetorical précis from Cuyamaca College](https://www.cuyamaca.edu/student-support/tutoring-center/files/student-resources/rhetorical-precis-description-and-examples.pdf). %%

%%
[Dr. Pacheco-Vega], in [his blog article] titled "[Triaging your reading workload]" ([2019]), argues that [the ways in which we decide when to read an article in more depth can and should vary by individuals and is best learned by experience]. [He] supports this claim by [providing examples of techniques that work for him but others have claimed are not effective as well as vice versa] and finally [encouraging readers to develop their own guidelines for deciding what merits further reading]. [Pachecho-Vega]'s purpose is to [show how to more effectively process reading workloads] in order to [help students and researchers make better decisions about what to read in more depth]. [He] adopts [an informal tone] for the readers of [his blog] and others interested in the topic of [knowledge management].

## Notes
 > Most of these students were identified as "ESL" and tracked through the registrar by their visa/immigration status, and the resident multilingual population (generally smaller than the international student population) went largely untracked. [page 216]
 
 > I consulted with the Intensive English Program on campus to determine whether it was possible to justify *fluency* as a curricular outcome for first-year composition, without precluding a commitment to multilingualism or to process pedagogy. [page 217]
 
 > I aligned the course with Leki's (1992) sequenced writing project. [page 218]
 
 > The curriculum included four units, each one guided by a discursive "move" (Swales, 1981; Swales, 1990) [page 218]
 
 > relying on learning methodologies based in three core principles: (1) linguistic and discursive "shuttling" (Canagarajah, 2002a, 2006); (2) a renewed commitment to interlanguage (Kutz, 1986; Tardy & Swales, 2009); and (3) "language salience" (Shuck, 2010). [page 220]
 
 > "interlanguage" (Kutz, 1986). Kutz has suggested using this term to describe contact zones between practices, perceptions, and beliefs about what writers of all levels can do, thereby challenging the dichotomy between actual and perceived fluency and suggesting a pedagogy that recognizes a productive relationship between what has been taught so far and what the learner knows and can do at any given point in time (p. 45). [page 221]
 
 > Ortega and Carlson (2010) define "linguistic compentence"-- as a demonstration of how micro- and macro-contexts *help reveal students' embeddedness in their language tasks*. [page 221--222]
 
 > in a sequenced project, it is not uncommon for students to be more linguistically accurate in some genres than in others [page 222]
 
 [[Circumstantial bilingualism is the idea that a person may be proficient in English for specific situations, but less capable in others]]

> Yet our goal was not 100% accuracy in the students' final drafts, but to see marked imrpovement in things we and the students together identified as needing improvement, as well as their conscious understanding of how they attained it. [page 223]
