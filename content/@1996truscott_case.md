## Notes
> My thesis is that grammar correction has no place in writing courses and should be abandoned. (page 328)

> I do not deny the value of grammatical accuracy; the issue is whether or not grammar correction can contribute to its development. (page 329)

> By *grammar correction*, I mean correction of grammatical errors for the purpose of improving a student's ability to write accurately. This correction comes in many different forms, but for present purposes such distinctions have little significant, simply because there is no reason to think any of the variations should be used in writing classes, and there is considerable reason to think they are all misguided. (page 329)

> there is a great deal of evidence regarding first language (L1) writing. (page 329)

I don't see how L1 studies could be relevant-- people are constantly exposed to positive L1 feedback.

> These studies on L1 learning certainly do not prove that correction is ineffective in L2 language learning; conceivably a technique that is not helpful in the one case could be helpful in the other. But they certainly provide strong grounds for doubt; in view of their results, it would be folly to assume, without strong evidence, that correction is useful in L2 learning. In other words, the effect of the L1 research is to place the burden of proof firmly on those who would claim that correction is helpful. (page 330)

> [[Hendrickson (1978)]] reviewed the available research and concluded that little was known. He claimed that learners should be corrected, but the work he reviewed did not support such a view. His own work ([[1978 Hendrickson|1978]], and in more detail in [[1981 Hendrickson|Hendrickson, 1981]]) indicated that correcting all errors was no better than correcting only those that produced communicative problems: Neither method had any significant effects. A few more recent papers ([[1992 Krashen|Krashen, 1992]]; [[Leki (1990a)|Leki, 1990]]; [[Resources/Articles/VanPatten (1986)|VanPatten, 1986a]], [[VanPatten (1986b)|1986b]]) have briefly reviewed the evidence, all of them reaching the same conclusion: Grammar correction is ineffective. (page 330)

[[Several studies have concluded that grammar correction does not lead to grammar acquisition]]

> [[1976 Cohen & Robbins|Cohen and Robbins (1976)]], for instance, examining the written corrections received by three students in an advanced ESL course, concluded that "the corrections did not seem to have any significant effect on students' errors (p. 50)." (page 330)

Three subjects is definitely not enough. Why would he even include this?

> [[1984 Semke|Semke's (1984)]] large, 10-week study of German students produced similar results. She divided the students into four groups, each receiving a different type of feedback. Group 1 received only comments on content, with no concern for errors. Group 2 received only comments on errors. Group 3 received both types of comments, and Group 4 had their errors pointed out and were expected to make corrections themselves. Semke found no significant differences among the groups in the accuracy of their writing. In addition, Group 1 (comments on content only) was significantly better than all the others on fluency and on a cloze test. (page 331)

I wonder, though, of those that *did* improve; what can we know about them? It may well be that explicit grammar correction works under certain conditions or with certain people.

> Those who received comments on content plus correction were significantly inferior to those who received only comments on content. (page 331)

[[Feedback on content was found to be more effective than feedback on grammar and sentence structure]]

> Semke also found Group 4 (self-correction) inferior to all the other groups on fluency--evidence against the use of a technique frequently recommended in the literature (but always with little or no supporting evidence; e.g., Bartram & Walton, 1991; Hendrickson, 1978, 1980; Higgs, 1979; Hyland, 1990; Raimes, 1983). (page 331)

> Robb, Ross, and Shortreed (1986) [...] used four very different types of feedback: (a) explicit correction, indicating the errors and the correct forms; (b) the use of a correction code to point out type and location of errors; (c) the use of highlighting to indicate the location of errors, without any explanation; and (d) a marginal tally of the number of errors in each line, with no indication of what the errors were or where in the line they were located. In all four conditions, students were to rewrite their compositions, making the appropriate changes. At the end of the course, the authors found no significant differences in the students' writing ability.

This seems like a very challenging research problem. The amount of researcher labor required to set up the conditions and code the results is enormous and very difficult to maintain inter-rater reliability throughout the process. If a large language model can be trained to point out specific types of errors reliably, we could expand this into a much, much bigger project.

[[Leveraging AI to conduct SLA research]]

> For one thing, the amount of information contained in the feedback varied so much among the four groups that one would expect significant differences among them if the information were at all valuable. That there were no differences argues strongly against its having any value. 

I don't think that's how it works. Whether there is no value or any value, we cannot separate the noise if there isn't a consistent signal.

Surely there are some students who do learn from error correction; any case studies?

> In fact, Frantzen and Rissel (1987) found that, even when told the exact location of an error, learners usually could not determine exactly what the error was; [...] it would be extremely surprising if the learners in the fourth group gained any insights from their much more limited information. So one can reasonably treat these learners as a control group. (page 332)

> More evidence of this ineffectiveness comes from Kepner (1991), who experimented with two forms of feedback in intermediate Spanish as a foreign language (FL) courses. Half the participants received comprehensive correction on sentence-level errors with brief explanations or statements of rules; the other half received comments on content instead, written in the target language. Kepner then checked their sixth assignment, written after 12 weeks of instruction, for grammatical accuracy, as measured by a count of all grammar and vocabulary errors. Kepner checked the quality of the writing's content by measuring the number of "higher-level propositions" it contained. Kepner found no significant differences in accuracy. However, students who had received content-oriented feedback were significantly superior in the measure of content. These results held for both high-verbal-ability and low-verbal-ability students, and there were no significant interactions between the variables. Thus, once again grammar correction was not helpful. (page 332)

[[Studies in the error correction debate]]

> For accurate marking of sentence boundaries (through appropriate punctuation), the content group made significant gains, the error group did not, and the difference was significant. [...] on a measure of the complexity of students' writing-- the relative frequency with which they used subordinate clauses-- the content group had no significant changes, although the error group got significantly worse (though there was no significant difference *between* the two groups on this measure). Sheppard attributed this latter result to an avoidance strategy on the part of the students who had been frequently corrected-- their fear of making mistakes led them to limit the complexity of their writing. (page 333)

> Correction was not only unhelpful in these studies but also actually hindered the learning process. (page 333)

> Similarly, VanPatten (1986b, 1988) described two studies by Dvorak, one covering a full year, in which lack of correction did not affect students' accuracy. Dvorak's research was primarily concerned with oral correction, but apparently covered some written work as well. (page 333)

> the results probably cannot be explained by the difference between FL and SL learning, the identity of the target language, or the learner's L1. The studies that found correction ineffective included ESL, EFL, German FL, and Spanish FL; besides, the students' origins and L1s differed widely. (page 334)

> Another factor that can probably be dismissed is the form of correction used. (page 334).

> Another explanation of the results is that the correction used in these studies could have had a delayed effect that did not show up during the research. However, available evidence argues against such a view: Robb et al.'s (1986) study, covering mid-April to mid-January, showed no more evidence of beneficial effects than did studies lasting a single semester or a single quarter. Nor did Dvorak's year-long study. Besides the lack of any a priori reasons to expect delayed effects, this (admittedly limited) research makes the possibility of such effects rather remote. (page 334)

I think what we know in general about learning and memory, it's only more likely they'd lose any benefit with time.

> the consistent failure of grammar correction probably cannot be attributed to any particular form of instruction; the studies vary substantially in this regard. (page 335)

> It's also unlikely that the lack of benefits can be explained by the student's proficiency level or ability. The classes studied ranged from beginning to advanced levels of language proficiency. (page 336)

> the negative results in these studies could have been due not toproblems inherent in correction but rather to bad timing. Researchers investigating naturalistic L2 learning have found clear and consistent orders in which learners acquire certain grammatical structures; other research has found these same sequences in formal classroom learning situations, in spite of instructional sequences that run counter to them. (page 336--7)

[[Research on developmental sequences of grammar]]

> However, subsequent work on a variety of languages (e.g., [[1975 Cancino, Rosansky, & Schumann|Cancino, Rosansky, & Schumann, 1975]]; [[1984 Ellis|Ellis, 1984]], [[1988 Ellis|1988]], [[1989 Ellis|1989]]; [[1981 Felix|Felix, 1981]]; [[1977 Hyltenstam|Hyltenstam, 1977]]; [[1984 Pienemann|Pienemann, 1984]], [[1989 Pienemann|1989]]; [[1987 VanPatten|VanPatten, 1987]]; [[1987 Weinert|Weinert, 1987]]; [[1984 Wode|Wode, 1984]]) has left little doubt that developmental sequences are real. (page 337)

It's like when I try learning Korean, I can only remember and use feedback that I can remember, and I can only remember what I am able to connect to what I already know. It's basically the N+1 thing, but it's different for each person.

Follow up on these-- what is the sequence for English? Korean?
Is there a developmental sequence for vocabulary? Probably not, right? Paul Nation did some research on this, I think.

> The failure of grammar correction in the research could be due to a lack of concern with timing. However, the significance of this possibility is limited. There is no distinct evidence that properly timed correction will be effective; the possibility remains hypothetical. (page 337)

> A number of other studies commonly cited in discussions of correction deal only with oral contexts and therefore have little relevance to the issue of correction in writing classes (e.g., [[1977 Chaudron|Chaudron, 1977]]; [[1981 Herron|Herron, 1981]]; [[1988 Herron & Tomasello|Herron & Tomasello, 1988]]; [[1979 Ramirez & Stromquist|Ramirez & Stromquist, 1979]]; [[1988 Tomasello & Herron|Tomasello & Herron, 1988]], [[1989 Tomasello & Herron|1989]]).  (page 338)

A key difference, I'd venture, is the timing of the feedback (between oral and written). Oh, was the feedback oral, the content produced, or both?

> [[1990 Fathman & Whalley|Fathman and Whalley (1990)]] [...] have shown that students can produce better compositions when teachers help them with those particular compositions. But will those students be better writers in the future because of this help? Nothing in this study suggests a positive answer.  (page 339)

> [[1982 Lalande|Lalande's (1982)]] [...] The experimental group went through this program, but the control group-- this is the crucial point-- was taught through what Lalande described as a traditional type of writing course, which included comprehensive correction and *rewriting based on the corrections*.* Thus, Lalande did not compare the effects of correction with the effects of noncorrection, but rather with the effects of a different form of correction; as a result, he found his own version to be significantly better than the traditional alternative. 
> 
> However, "better than" could just as well read "less harmful than".  (page 339)

> Veteran teachers know there is little direct connection between correction and learning: Often a student will repeat the same mistake over and over again, even after being corrected many times. When this occurs, it is tempting for the teacher to say the student is not attentive or lazy; however, the pervasiveness of the phenomenon, even with successful students, argues against any such explanation. Rather the teacher should conclude that correction simply is not effective.  (page 341)

> It is difficult to escape the feeling that grammar correction must work, that it has to help students. In the face of these strong intuitions, probably no amount of evidence will convince many teachers ,students, or researchers that grammar correction is misguided. Thus, it is also necessary to undermine the intuitions, to show that correction does not have to help and in fact should not be expected to help.  (page 341)

> Research has made it clear that the development of interlanguage involves complex learning processes.  (page 342)

> as a consequence, teachers can easily lose sight of the process and adopt a simplistic view of learning as essentially the transfer of information from teacher to student.  (page 342)

> Its falsity is revealed by a simple observation made by Long ([[1977 Long|1977]]; [[1991 Long|1991]]), an observation repeatedly confirmed by research and that any teacher or learner can verify: Language learning rarely, if ever, works the way that this simple view says it does. The acquisition of a grammatical structure is a gradual process, not a sudden discovery (page 342)

[[Grammar acquisition is a gradual process and does not respond to traditional instruction methods]]

> Teaching practices that rely on transfer of knowledge, without any concern for the processes underlying the development of the language system, are not promising. Grammar correction, as almost universally practiced, does exactly that. (page 343)

Is this why Olga lets students use those verb tense charts during assessments? I understand it now. It's still worthwhile to assess their productive skills without it, but not as a measure for the course.

> research on developmental sequences eventually could be translated into practices that work in the classroom; but this goal has not been achieved yet, and it is by no means certain that it will ever be (page 343)

⭐page 342. 
Explain why I won't penalize students for not learning grammar on schedule.

> There is some reason to think that syntactic, morphological, and lexical knowledge are acquired in different manners ([[1993 Schwartz|Schwartz, 1993]]). If this is the case, then probably no single form of correction can be effective for all three. (page 343)

I think this is the basis of the treatable and non-treatable errors that other researchers have talked about.

> But it might be more reasonable to see words and affixes this way; so perhaps teachers can constructively transfer lexical and morphological information to learners by means of correction. (page 343)

> the research reviewed in the preceding section argues against any such conclusion. In those studies, inflectional morphology (verb forms especially) was a standard target for correction, as were lexical errors. In neither case were any benefits found. Thus, although lexical and morphological knowledge might in theory be more amenable to correction than syntactic knowledge, this amenability does not seem to make any practical difference. (page 343)

> the acquisition of lexical and morphological knowledge involves subtle learning processes. (Some idea of the complexity involved can be obtained from [[1993 Clark|Clark, 1993]].) To be effective, correction must address these processes, not just pass information from teacher to learner. (page 344)

[[Labor-based grading contracts]] contracts could focus more on this process.

Is there a platform that lets teachers assign flashcards?

> Research described above shows that much of L2 grammatical learning follows natural orders, ... Learning consists of the gradual development of a system, based in large part on complex learning processes, so none should expect regular patterns of development, independent of what occurs in the classroom. (page 344)

> Very few, if any, writing teachers ever consider the issue of developmental sequences. (page 344)

Is there a way to pre-test for these?

> Research on English learning is sufficient to tell us that such sequences exist, but as a general guide for teachers it is hopelessly inadequate. (page 344)

> there is some evidence that different groups of learners may differ on the details of the sequences they follow ([[1981 Meisel, Clahsen, & Pienemann|Meisel, Clahsen, & Pienemann, 1981]]; [[1985 Nicholas|Nicholas, 1985]]) (page 345)

[[There is some research to support that groups of learners can acquire language in different sequences]]

Follow up with these sources to see what groups they're talking about.

So how do we know if a student is ready for correction?

> Teachers might try to get around these problems by correcting all errors: Some of them will no doubt be errors for which the learner is ready. ... given the enormous amount of distraction learners receive from corrections for which they are not ready, along with the problems that this technique imposes on teachers (page 345)

[[Students can be distracted by too many corrections and be unable to use corrections for features which they are ready to acquire]]

> Interlanguage develops through subtle, poorly understood processes. it would be surprising if all types of teaching/learning were consistent with them. Rather, some will fail to affect the underlying, developing system, instead producing only a superficial and possibly transient form of knowledge, with little value for actual use of  the language. Such learning would be better described as *[[pseudolearning|psuedolearning]]*. if the knowledge acquired through grammar correction is, or can be, [[pseudolearning|psuedoknowledge]], then teachers have additional reason to doubt the technique's value. (page 345)

> [[Ellis (1988)]] described *modelled* learning, which has little connection to more useful *communicative* learning. ... Ellis ([[1988 Ellis|1993]], [[1994 Ellis|1994]]) become concerned with the distinction between *implicit* and *explicit* knowledge of grammar (page 346)

> [[Lightbown (1985)]] talked about *[[pseudolearning|pseudoacquisition]]*-- apparent success that turns out to be only apparent. (page 346)

> [[McLaughlin (1990)]] was concerned about new knowledge being integrated into the learner's language system; if it does not get integrated then the learning is not real learning. (page 346)

> [[Long (1977)]] expressed concern as to whether a given instance of learning would help the learner in general, or only in monitoring contexts. (page 346)

> And of course there is the most frequently cited view of this sort [[1987 Krashen|Krashen's (1987)]] concept of *learning*, as opposed to *acquisition*, the latter being what really counts in second language acquisition. (page 346)

> The same distinction was made by [[Schwartz (1986)]], who used the terms *learned linguistic knowledge* and *competence*. (page 346)

> [[Felix (1987)]] also made a distinction of this sort, between the workings of a specifically linguistic learning system and a nonspecific and relatively inefficient problem solver. (page 346)

> there is a widespread acceptance of the distinction between knowledge of language and knowledge about language, the latter being referred to as *metalinguistic knowledge*. There is no consensus as to its exact nature, but its relatively limited value for learners is clear. (page 346)

> This concern is supported by research that showed learners had acquired good intellectual knowledge of the target language but had no ability to use this knowledge (e.g., [[1988 Kadia|Kadia, 1988]]; [[Schumann (1978a)|Schumann, 1978a]], [[Schumann (1978b)|1978b]]; [[1987 Terrell, Baycroft, & Perrone|Terrell, Baycroft, & Perrone, 1987]]). (page 346)

> follow-up testing and observation showed that knowledge which students had apparently acquired actually disappeared in a matter of months, probably indicating that the teaching had produced nothing more than [[psuedolearning]] ([[1989 Harley|Harley, 1989]]; [[1983 Lightbown|Lightbown, 1983b]], [[1985 Lightbown|1985]], [[1987 Lightbown|1987]]; [[1980 Lightbown, Spada, & Wallace|Lightbown, Spada, & Wallace, 1980]]; [[1989 Pienemann|Pienemann, 1989]]; [[1987 Weinert|Weinert, 1987]]; [[1991 White|White, 1991]]). (page 346--347)

> Thus, in discussing the effects of teaching practices, researchers must e concerned not only with whether learning has resulted, but also with what kind of learning: If it is simply an instance of [[pseudolearning]], then the instruction has not been successful. (page 347)

So it seems the whole progression of controlled activities to open, auhentic activities should also be questioned -- as if the former leads to the latter.

> Second language editing actually depends far more on intuitions of well-formedness, coming from he unconscious language system, than on metalinguistic knowledge points of grammar. Evidence comes from studies showing a dissociation between the ability to correct an error and the ability to state a rule that could guide the correction. (page 347)

So when a student knows its wrong but can't say why; that's gold. I keep saying I want both-- but metalnguistic knowledge should not be necessary if unconscious systems are fine.

> [[1992 Green & Hecht|Green and Hecht's (1992)]], in which they showed 300 German EFL students nine English grammar errors commonly committed by German students. They asked the students to correct the errors and to give a rule in each case. They found that learners who could not state a rule or who stated a wrong rule were nonetheless able to make a proper correction in most cases. (page 347--348)

[[Whether a student can articulate a grammar rule is independent of whether they can identify an error]]

> What is clear is that learners' error correction was based primarily (if not entirely) on their intuitions rather than on explicit knowledge of correct and incorrect forms. (page 348)

> [[Gass (1983)]] also concluded that the ability to correct errors is distinct from the ability to state the rules underlying the corrections. (page 348)

> [[Seliger (1979)]] observed a similar dissociation between the ability to correctly use a rule (a vs. an) and metalinguistic awareness of that rule. (page 348)

>[[Sorace (1985)]] also found that students' ability to identify errors and make corrections greatly exceeded their ability to state the rules required for the corrections. (page 348)

> The limits of this sort of knowledge for editing are also evident in comments from the students interviewed by [[1976 Cohen & Robbins|Cohen and Robbins (1976)]]. (page 348)

> students favor their intuitions over the things they are told by writing teachers. (page 348)

Maybe this is the way to [[Writing and grammar diagnostic|pre-test grammar competencies]] in sequence. Give students a list of ungrammatical sentences and ask them to re-write them.

> the problem of [[psuedolearning]], along with problems stemming from the existence of developmental sequences, provides good reason to doubt the value of grammar correction. Its general failure to deal with interlanguage as a system that develops by its own processes makes its prospects very dim. (page 349)

What even is interlanguage? 
Is language acquisition like muscle memory? Do athletes and dancers have the same process learning their skill?

> teachers may well know that an error has occurred but not know exactly why it is an error. If they do understand it well, they might still be unable to give a good explanation; problems that need explaining are often very complex. (page 350)

For example, my analogy of heavy vs. light verbs for the purposes of subject-auxiliary inversion and do-support.

> [[1976 Cohen & Robbins|Cohen and Robbins (1976)]] and [[Zamel (1985)]], in fact, found serious problems regarding the quality of teacher's written responses to L2 compositions. (page 350)

> some studies cited by [[Cohen (1987)]] concluded that L1 students often pay no attention to corrections.  (page 351)

> [[1987 Cohen|Cohen's (1987)]] survey of mixed L1/L2 students found that, when they received corrections, students generally did nothing more than make a mental note of them. Moreover, students who rewrote their compositions )and they did so only when required to) generally did not make use of the corrections in their rewriting, even when they had no trouble understanding them. (page 351--352)

> [[1988 Radecki & Swales|Radecki and Swales (1988)]] also found that ESL students were not particularly serious in the way they dealt with corrections and more often than not were reluctant to do any rewriting, many seeing it as a form of punishment. Similar results were obtained by [[1990 Cohen & Cavalcanti|Cohen and Cavalcanti (1990)]] and by [[Saito (1994)]] (page 352)

> selective correction seems to be the generally accepted approach these days (e.g., [[1991 Bartram & Walton|Bartram & Walton, 1991]]; [[1972 Burt & Kiparsky|Burt & Kiparsky, 1972]]; [[1988 Bryne|Bryne, 1988]]; [[1988 Celce-Murcia & Hilles|Celce-Murcia & Hilles, 1988]]; [[1989 Edge|Edge, 1989]]; [[1993 Mings|Mings, 1993]]; [[1983 Raimes|Raimes, 1983]]). (page 352)

> various studies on L1 writing, reviewed in [[1981 Knoblauch & Brannon|Knoblauch and Brannon (1981)]], and in [[Hillocks (1986]]), found that it makes no difference whether corrections are comprehensive or selective. For L2, [[Hendrickson (1981)]] failed to find any difference  between comprehensive correction and correction restricted to communicative errors. (page 352--353)

> selective correction must be consistent with learners' developmental stages if it is to be effective, but teachers currently do not base corrections on these stages, and limited understanding of them makes it impossible to do so. (page 353)

> correction is not only unhelpful but even counterproductive. First, learning is most successful when it involves only a limited amount of stress, when students are relaxed and confident and enjoying their learning; but the use of correction encourages exactly the opposite condition. (page 354)

> [[1981 Knoblauch & Brannon|Knoblauch and Brannon (1981)]] and by [[Hillocks (1986)]]: Students who did not receive correction had a more positive attitude toward writing than those who did. The uncorrected students were not better writers as a result, but they wrote more, presumably because of their better attitude. (page 354)

[[Truscott claims that error correction has a negative effect on students' attitudes]]

> In L2 research, three studies mentioned earlier found grammar correction harmful rather than just ineffective. [[Semke (1984)]] found that uncorrected students wrote more and were superior on a cloze test. She also cited evidence (from Rinderer) that correction harms ESL students' motivation. [[Kepner (1991)]] and [[Sheppard (1992)]] found that grammar correction significantly harmed the complexity of students' writing; Sheppard's uncorrected students also showed a superior grasp of sentence boundaries.  (page 354)

> The probable source of these problems is, again, the inherent unpleasantness of correction. Students shorten and simplify their writing in order to avoid corrections; they do not learn as well as uncorrected students because  they have developed a less favorable attitude toward learning. (page 355)

It's not just that, but in my own experience with Korean, my brain only has space for one type of correction at a time. In line with earlier statements about [[Developmental Sequences in SLA]].

> Students obviously do think correction is helpful-- and even necessary-- so one should not be surprised that they want it in spite of its unpleasantness. In this context, it is also not surprising that students who believe in correction are still reluctant to work in any serious way with the corrections they receive, as noted previously. (page 355)

> Thus, the time problem causes the attention of teachers and learners to be diverted from other aspects of writing, such as organization and logical development of arguments. (page 355--356)

> [[1987 Cohen|Cohen's (1987)]] survey, that most students in writing classes had received a great deal of correction on grammar and mechanics, but relatively little on organization and content, even in advanced classes. It should not be surprising hat so little attention is given to high-level aspects, in view of the enormous amount of time and effort presumably going into low-level feedback in these classes. (page 356)

> [[Santos (1988)]] found that content-area instructors in the U.S. tend to be reasonably tolerant of grammatical errors made by nonnatives, and much less tolerant of problems with content. Santos hence recommended that language instructors focus on skills that most directly affect the content of writing. [[1991 Leki|Leki's (1991)]] finding that ESL students recognize this situation is also interesting. Among the students she surveyed, two thirds said that error-free writing was not important to their content-area instructors (though it was to their English teachers and to them). Thus concern with grammar correction is harmful if it diverts class resources from more appropriate tasks. (page 356)

> [[Hendrickson (1978)]], dealing with the question of whether or not students should be corrected, based his affirmative answer partly on the argument that learners often cannot identify their own mistakes and therefore need a more knowledgeable person to point them out. (page 357)

But, then, **how do** people learn a language?

> [[Herron (1981)]] made the same argument for oral contexts. This is no doubt an accurate statement about students' limitations, but as an argument for correction it simply begs the question, making the groundless (and I would argue, false) assumption that students will benefit by having their errors pointed out to them. (page 357)

So then *how **do*** people learn a language? Not through explicit instruction, but through a gradual acquisition. Something about [[Cognitive science]] and different brain modes; diffuse network and focused network or something like that, maybe?

> There is little or no reason to believe that a lack of concern with grammar will lead to fossilization. The claim that grammar correction can prevent fossilization is particularly dubious in view of the evidence presented above that correction is ineffective in general. (page 358)

> [[Omaggio (1986)]] ... included some unsupported claims about fossilization (based in part on [[1982 Higgs & Clifford|Higgs & Clifford, 1982]]), some theoretical views on the development of interlanguage, extensive comments on the way native speakers react to errors, her evaluation of various types of correction, and brief mentions of [[Lalande (1982)]], [[Higgs (1979)]], [[Kulhavy (1977)]], and [[Hendrickson (1980)]]--none of whom offer any evidence that language learners benefit from grammar correction (or any other type of feedback). (page 358)

> When students hold a demonstrably false believe about learning, the proper response is not to encourage that belief, but to show them that it is false. (page 359)

> in every case in which differences were found, they favored the uncorrected learners. (page 359)

> The issue raised by students' beliefs is not whether teachers should continue to use grammar correction, but how they best help learners adjust to its absence. Some writers have offered suggestions on this subject ([[1991 Bartram & Walton|Bartram & Walton, 1991]]; [[1991 Leki|Leki, 1991]]), and further work could prove useful. But the decision to abandon grammar correction is in no way dependent on such work. (page 359--360)

> This leaves the question of what teachers should do in writing classes. The answer, implicit in the preceding discussion, is straightforward: anything except grammar correction. My arguments have no implications for the teaching of other aspects of writing, except that abandoning grammar correction will allow teachers to devote more time and effort to them. (page 360)

Maybe I can try to map student's natural language learning by having them write journal entries about what they learned each week.

> current research and theory inevitably have their limits, so one cannot overlook the possibility that future developments will dictate a weakening of my thesis. (page 361)

> Future research on learner variables might show that certain subgroups of learners can benefit from correction under certain circumstances. (page 361)

> Future research on developmental sequences could conceivably furnish the knowledge to provide truly beneficial feedback. (page 361)
