# Latinx Youths' Plurilingual Abilities as Workplace Abilities and Program Change
> [!summary] Summary
> Enright and Bencomo Garcia (2021) described the challenges and recommendations of Latinx youth placed in high school work study programs.

## Notes
> we emphasize language users' shepherding of all available communicative resources to accomplish goal-directed activity that is personally and culturally meaningful to them. (page 157)

[[Students can pursue language learning projects related to their personal and professional needs]]

> familial responsibilities requiring sophisticated uses of their plurilingual skills. (page 157)

> two goals: (a) to document plurilingual abilities leveraged by Latinx youth to do complex work tasks both at work and with family to highlight their routine engagement in cognitively and socially complex work tasks; and (b) to describe the ever-increasing roles of youths' plurilingual abilities in contributing to systemic program change in the school's work-study program. (page 157)

> Information presented *about* youth at school fundraising events framed youth as deserving but lacking essential opportunities and experiences, with no attention to their family or community-based talents and resources. (page 157)

[[The dominant narrative of multilingual students is deficit-based]]

> Youth reported the greatest prevalence of deficit perspectives and low expectations among work-study supervisors employed by sponsoring work sites. (page 157)

> Responses revealed that 85% of students spoke Spanish at home, with more than 60% serving as language brokers for loved ones and neighbors. (page 158)

> At all educational levels in the United States, schools and post-secondary institutions directly or indirectly sort students into different educational contexts, opportunities, and trajectories based on their abilities to interpret and produce "academic" uses of English, with expectations ranging from producing language forms that match those of the systemically privileged ([[2015 Flores|Flores, 2015]]), to using specific forms and functions of language in English to interpret and produce disciplinary-specific kinds of meaning ([[2004 Schleppegrell|Schleppegrell, 2004]]). (page 158)

> By dichotomizing language as "academic" and "non-academic," the only language and literacy practices considered "advanced" are those that match the practices and forms of language taught and assessed in schools. Calls to expand what counts as "academic" language ([[2006 Bunch|Bunch, 2006]]; [[2011 Enright|Enright, 2011]]), or to abandon notions of language and literacy in producing and sustaining systemic inequalities related to native languages, dialects, and proficiencies. (page 158--159)

[[Insistence on Academic English privileges those with experience with that dialect in the home]]

> We designed Survey 2 (also in English and Spanish) based on questions that arose for us from Survey 1 findings and these workplace visits. Survey 2 asked more specific questions about the kinds of language brokering engaged in by youth, their purposes and uses of technology and media, and potential leveraging of knowledge and skills across contexts of home, school, and work. (page 160)

> Many, however, complained to Kerry and Alicia, the facilitators of the focus groups, that their supervisors did not know them as people, underestimated their abilities, and assigned them menial tasks instead of "real work." (page 161)

> In our worksite lunches with youth, they consistently shared that most of their classroom teachers also knew little about their lives beyond school walls, voicing care that felt genuine to students, but disconnected from their lived experiences. It was rare for adults to facilitate connections between youths' learning and their everyday lives at work or school. (page 162)

> The positioning of youth as experts and leaders in front of a room full of supervisors was important to counter deficit narratives and perspectives that often constrained these young people's abilities to lead at work and in society. (page 163)

> Survey learners beyond your classroom, or have students survey others in their social networks, so that learners can see themselves as part of a broader community with similar linguistic struggles and triumphs. (page 172)

> Flip roles and teacher/learner positions to level the power differences between students and adults who work with them, (page 172)

Good guiding principle for writing or speaking projects.

> Create questions or problems that *require* student input so that their role is not simply to witness or advise. (page 173)

[[Projects should require student knowledge to promote agency]]
