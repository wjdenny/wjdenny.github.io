> Price conducted qualitative interviews with anxious foreign language students and uncovered perfectionism and fear of public speaking as significant variables.
## Notes
### Introduction
> Although anxiety has long been recognized by educators as a potential problem in the foreign language classroom, relatively little research has ben conducted in this area. Investigations of foreign language anxiety have been for the most part quantitive studies, primarily correlational research. In the 1960s and 1970s, a number of studies on the relationship between foreign language proficiency and learner variables examined anxiety among other variables (Chastain, 1975; Pimsleur, Sundland, & McIntyre, 1964; Tucker et al., 1976; Gardner et al., 1976; Swain & Barnaby, 1976; Backman, 1976). [page 101]

> In the last decade, foreign language anxiety research has taken several directions. One direction has been to reexamine the anxiety-proficiency relationship using measures designed to assess the specific construct of foreign language anxiety ([[@1991young_relationship|Young, 1986, this volume]]). [page 101--102]

> An alternative approach to investigation of these relationships is qualitative research, which allows the researcher to obtain descriptive information on variables not easily assessed through empirical research. It can also provide a way to view phenomena from the point of view of the subject. A small number of researchers have attempted to use qualitative methos to investigate foreign language anxiety. In McCoy's (1979) study, language students identified 11 sources of anxiety about foreign language classes. Baily (1983) studied language learners' diaries and found a relationship between anxiety and competitiveness among foreign language learners. [[@1991horwitz_foreign|Horwitz, Horwitz, and Cope (1986, this volume)]] used information obtained during a support group for anxious language studies to develop a theory of foreign language anxiety.

### The present study
#### Methodology
### The interviews
#### The experience of foreign language anxiety
#### Classroom sources of anxiety
> They all responded that the greatest source of anxiety was having to speak the target language in front of their peers. They all spoke of their fears of being laughed at by the others, of making a fool of themselves in public. Several had painful memories of being ridiculed by other students, particularly in secondary school language classes. [page 105]

For this and other reasons, perhaps giving students more opportunities to complete genuine communicative tasks with native speakers would be ideal.

> The subjects were also concerned about making errors in pronunciation ... She added, "You knew you that you were never, never going to be able to say it like he did ... you were going to fail at pronouncing those words." [page 105]

> A third source of stress for these students was the frustration of not being able to communicate effectively. Several mentioned that they knew they were intelligent adults but couldn't communicate that way in French. Said one subject, "You feel frustrated because you're an interesting adult and you sound like a babbling baby." [page 105]

Sources of anxiety included speaking the second language in front of classmates, inaccurate pronunciation, and being unable to express themselves.

> The discrepancy between effort and results seemed to be most disturbing to students who were used to making high grades. These students seemed to feel less in control in language classes than in other courses. [page 105]

I notice this a lot in many of our ELA students. They did well in university back home, or are generally just very hard-working in school, but still struggle to meet the goals of the course. This often gets misdirected as either anger at the instructor or with themselves.

#### Causes of anxiety
> Quantitative research has investigated the relationship between foreign language anxiety and certain personality variables. The present interviews suggest two personality variables that may be related to foreign language anxiety-- perfectionism and fear of public speaking. Several subjects mentioned that they were very anxious about public speaking and several believed that they were overly perfectionistic. [page 106]

#### The role of the instructor
> Each had vivid memories of past teachers and how these teachers had treated them in class. In some cases, instructors had alleviated their anxiety. One student mentioned that she became much more calm after being in a class where the teacher encouraged mistakes and periodically discussed the importance of making mistakes in order to learn. Another student relaxed on the first da of an intermediate French class in which the instructor walked around the room and asked everyone to describe his and her language learning background. The student realized then that the other students were not any more advanced than she. [page 106]

> Conversely, some teachers had increased students' anxiety, such as those who criticized students' accents or the high school instructor who walked around the room with a big yardstick and flung it on the desk of anyone who wasn't listening, yelling, "Pay attention!" The most common complain about instructors was that many of those had made classroom time a performance rather than learning time. As Anne, the student mentioned earlier, put it, "It was never a learning experience. You either did it right or you didn't."

This is what I noticed about my classes awhile back. In other words, I was subconsciously expecting students to already know more than what I thought I was. There is still some conflict, though, because at some point you need to draw the line. If you're teaching an advanced language class, you can't spend learning time covering the alphabet or basic computer skills.

#### How can language learning made made less stressful?
> Some very concrete suggestions for alleviating anxiety were offered. There was a general feeling that smaller classes would help a great deal. Several mentioned that getting to know the other students helped them to feel more relaxed by reducing the fear of being ridiculed an taking away the feeling that the others are all smarter and more confident. [page 107]

> The subjects suggested a number of measures that instructors could take to reduce anxiety, such as giving students more positive reinforcement, encouraging them to make mistakes, and helping them to develop more realistic expectations of themselves by letting them know that they weren't supposed to be fluent or have a perfect accent after two semesters. [page 107]

### Conclusion
> For students to feel comfortable about using the target language in the classroom it is important that they view the classroom as a place for learning and communication rather than as a place where they perform for the instructor. While a certain amount of evaluation is necessary and useful, students should not feel that they are performing each time they use the target language. Time could be allotted for communicative activities in which the student is corrected either not at all or only when absolutely necessary for comprehension. During such activities, the instructor would focus on the message the student is trying to communicate rather than on the accuracy of the student's grammar and pronunciation. [page 107]

How am I achieving this low-stakes communicative time in the ATAW courses?
