## Notes
> Communication apprehension is the fear or anxiety an indivudual feels about orally communicating. It is important to note that there are a number of other related constructs not directly tied to reality, but whihc nonetheless emphasize people’s anxieties about ommunucation. p. 4

[[Communication apprehension refers to anxiety around oral communication.]]

> There are three major ways communication apprehension has been measured: behavioral observation or ratings, physiological assessments, and self-reports. Each has a history of research associated with it and, interestingly, the three are relatively uncorrelated (Clevenger, 1959). p. 4

[[Behavioral, physiological, and experiential assessments of anxiety do not correlate with one another.]]

> There are at least 50 difference self-report measures in the literature ranging from single-item questions to extensive, well-developed, multifactor measures. n the field of communication, the most commonly used measure is one devised y cCroskey (1984a). Labeled the “Personal Report of Commmunication Apprehension” (PRCA), it is composed of 24 items that can be divided into four subscales tapping communication apprehension in four contexts (public speaking, meetings, groups, and dyadic exchanges). The PRCA has well-established validity and excellent reliability. p. 4

Is it still valid for second language English learners? I might try assessing anxiety in the beginning of all speaking courses.

> The first explanation [of the cause of communication apprehension] rests in the realm of genetic predisposition. Early research on fraternal and identical twins, later research on twins raised apart, and, most recently, studies of adopted children consistently indicate that one’s genetic legacy may be a substantial contributor to one’s apprehension. The research hasn’t actually looke at commjnication apprehension per se. Instead, research has focused on the hereditary basis of various temperament characteristics such as soiability and activity (Buss, 1988), which represent core underlying dimensions of communication apprehension. p. 5

[[Genetics plays a major role in social temerament and therefore in communication apprehension.]]

> One’s history of reinforcements and punishments related to the act of communication may also play a central role in the development of communication apprehension. Individuals who, from early childhood, find that their attempts to communicate are greeted with negative reactions by significant others will quickly learn that staying quiet is more highly rewarded than talking. p. 5

I could also survey students to see how their elders felt about early attempts to learn English.

[[Early reactions to language use has an influence on the development of communication apprehension.]]

> Work on learned helplessness stressed the importance of consistency in rewards and punishments. Random and inconsistent patterns of rewards, punishments, and nonresponses for engaging in the same activity were hypothesized to lead to behavioral withdrawal. p. 5

[[Learned helplessness is the idea that a person can withdraw from social activities when they feel unable to predict whether their action will result in positive or negative reactions]]

[[Learned helplessness may explain some cases of communication apprehension]]

> Children who are not provided with the opportunity to garner good communication skills early in life are more likely to be apprehensive than those who receive a wealth of early experience in communication. Although the evidence for this explanation is indirect at best, there does seem to be some justification for believing that skill development is related to the development of apprehension. It may well be that the critical issue is when skills develop. p. 5

> People don’t talk, and fear talking, for any number of reasons, only one of which may be communication anxiety. In the typical classroom, students might avoid taking because they are unprepared, uninterested, unwilling to disclose, alienated from the class, lacking confidence in their competence, or because they fear communicating. (A much more thorough description of this idea can be found in McCroskey [1987]). p. 6

[[There can be many reasons for a student’s unwillingness to talk.]]

> In early studies, scholars found that teachers have a positive bias towards talkative children in their classrooms. When presented with descriptions of students that varied only in the purported degree of apprehension each child had, teachers were much more favorably disposed toward the nonapprehensive student (McCroskey & Daly, 1976). … This bias is reflected in the policy of many teachers to include classroom participation in grade calculations. p. 6—7

[[Instructors are more likely to favor students with less communication apprehension.]]

> While there is consistent research demonstrating no difference in intelligence between high and low apprehensive students, there is considerable evidence suggesting that by the time students leave high school, low apprehensives are better prepared academically. They do better on standardized measures of academic achievement (McCroskey & Andersen, 1976) and, in college, have higher overall grade point averages. Indeed, some recent research suggests that highly apprehensive students are more likely to drop out of college than are low apprehensive ones. p. 7

[[Students with less anxiety have higher levels of achievement and preparedness.]]

> We live in an educational world where orality is seen as a necessary, positive personal characteristic. Apprehensive students, through years of veiled discrimination, must feel the impact of this bias in a series of significant, long-lasting consequences. Over time, the system they are part of regularly discriminates against them. 

[[The reliance on oral performance is an indirect form of discrimination against people with communication apprehension.]]

> Interestingly, the impact of communication apprehension in the educational setting is not limited to the student. Teachers' levels of apprehension also impact on what happens in the school. For instance, apprehensive teachers are far more likely to be found at the lower level of grade school or at the college level (McCroskey, Andersen, Richmond, & Wheeless, 1981). They also generally receive less positive evaluations from their students (Richmond & McCroskey, 1988). p. 7

> One of the critical prerequisites for success in virtually any occupation is a person's ability (and willingness) to communicate. In initial employment interviews, some evidence suggest that highly apprehensive applications fare less well. They are perceived less positively and are offered isgnifncantly lower starting salaries (Daly, Richmond, & Leth, 1979). In selecting positions, highly apprehensive individuals choose occupations which they perceive to have lower communication associated with them (and which, parenthetically, are usually of lower status) (Daly & McCroskey, 1975). p. 7

[[Communication apprehension also has negative effects in the workplace]]

How does this relate to self-advocacy? As in, is self-advocacy "apprehension" a form of communication apprehension?

> [A skill development] approach assumes that the major problem involved in apprehension is the person's limited knowledge about, or ability in, communication. Thus, if a person's skill at communicating is enhanced, his or her apprehension would be alleviated. In a rough sense, that is the basis of most communication classes. When people get more experience in actually talking, they will feel more comfortable about it. Regrettably, the weight of evidence does not support this reasoning. Some studies suggest that for highly apprehensive people a class that attempts to teach skills can actually boomerang-- making them even more apprehensive (Richmond, 1984; Richmond & McCroskey, 1988), a finding reminiscent of the vicious circle mentioned in the section on the development of the apprehension. Moreover, evidence also suggests that by the time people reach college the actual skill levels of high and low apprehensive individuals may not really be that different. What is different (in terms of magnitude) is the belief, on the part of the high apprehensive, that is or her skills are substantially less than average. p. 8

Most communication classes operate under the assumption that peoples' communication apprehension can be reduced by developing the necessary skills. [[Evidence does not support the idea that communication apprehension can be reduced through skills training alone]]

> The second research approach has a more clinical orientation. The most common behavioral therapy used on communication apprehension is systematic desensitization, a therapy that attempts to teach the anxious individual to link relaxation cues to images of communication events (Friedrich & Goss, 1984). This therapy has a long history of success with apprehension. There is also good data to suggest that it can be administered by people with relatively little training and can result in substantial changes after only five or six treatment sessions (many universities and colleges have ongoing systematic desensitization programs).  p. 8

[[Systematic desensitization is a technique that has been used to help with communication apprehension in communication classes.]]

> Another therapeutic approach is cognitive restructuring (Fremouw, 1984). The therapy challenges "irrational beliefs" held by an apprehensive individual about communication and attempts to replace them with self-statements that permit the individual to better cope with communication. p. 8--9

[[Cognitive restructuring is a technique that has been used to help with communication apprehension in communication classes.]]

> several characteristics of anxiety-provoking situations have been identified (Daly & Buss, 1984; Richmond & McCroskey, 1988):
> 
> - Evaluation. [...]
> - Novelty. [...]
> - Ambiguity. [...]
> - Conspicuousness. [...]
> - Prior History. [...]

High-stakes oral assessments tick nearly every one of those boxes.

[[Factors that effect severity of communication apprehension include evaluation, novelty, ambiguity, conspicuousness, and prior history.]]

> Classroom strategies ... 
> - Do not seat students alphabetically. [Or any assigned seating]
> - Don't require oral performance. [If you can avoid it.]
> - Don't call on students randomly.
> - Don't punish classroom talk.

> The fear of giving a public speech is the single biggest fear of the American population (Bruskin, 1973) exceeding such phobias as fear of snakes, heights, and elevators. Interestingly, in that survey, public speaking was a major fear of only those earning less than what today would be about $70,000. For those in higher-income brackets, public speaking was seldom a fear. p. 11-12

[[Fear of speaking is the most reported fear in the United States]]
[[Public speaking skills have significant economic value.]]

> evidence suggests that people who experience stage fright tend to become highly self-focused as a function of feeling conspicuous. Increased self-focus leads to reduced attention on the audience and the environment, leading, in turn, to poorer speech performances. p. 12

A useful cue for students might be to focus on the audience to counter the tendency to self-focus during an episode of stage fright.

> Extreme stage fright is often accompanied with rule rigidity.

Rule rigidity and communication apprehension go hand-in-hand.

> A second factor may be the labels people apply to the arousal they experience when speaking. Individuals who experience stage fright will often talk of the butterflies in their stomachs, the sweating palms, the racing heartbeat, the shaking hands. Although anxious people associate these manifestations with fear and anxiety, they might also be labeled "excitement." The arousal could be relabeled from fear to fun, from nervousness about failure to excitement about coming success. The actual physiological characteristics associated with fear and excitement are not that different. The critical issue is the label that one applies. p. 12

[[Re-labeling nervousness as excitement is a helpful cognitive restructuring technique.]] 

I should ask my classes if they feel anxious or nervous in various communication scenarios.

> A third factor in understanding stage fright is the audience. In conversations, meetings, and groups, audience characteristics play some role but certainly not as powerful a role as they do in public-speaking situations. In public speaking one is addressing an audience, and it can be difficult to adapt one's message properly to the audience. But certain characteristics of the audience can make it doubly difficult. For instance, the greater the heterogeneity of the audience the more anxious that speakers tend to be. p. 12

[[Audiences made up of different types of people can trigger speech anxiety]]
