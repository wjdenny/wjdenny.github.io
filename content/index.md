## What is *Antheum*?

Antheum is a digital garden, created by Will Denny. It is a play on the Greek *άνθεμον (anthemon / flower)* and *mουσεῖον (mouseion / library)*, taken to mean a digital garden.

A digital garden is a combination of a blog and a knowledge management system. Rather than static articles that are posted on a specific date, digital gardens have multiple pages of ideas that are grown, trimmed, or pruned over time.

So, Antheum is a collection of my notes as I research the topics and issues that I am studying. You'll also find notes on personal knowledge management, teaching, learning, language acquisition, social work and cultural psychology. Currently, I am interested in the experiences of linguistic minority students in higher education and issues of linguistic and cultural equity and diversity on college campuses.

Remember, these are *working* notes in the sense that the priority is function over form. You **will** find missing links, inconsistent formatting, and half-formed ideas. My philosophy with this collection is to develop and improve the topics that I am working on at the moment. I rarely spend time polishing notes from topics that are not otherwise taking up my attention.
