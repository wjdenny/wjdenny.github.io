## Notes

People who are often working hard to manage other peoples' problems tend to struggle with codependency.

> the antidote to codependency is learning to have bougie boundaries, managing your energy 

Could this also be described as reclaiming some of the white/male power boundaries that women and people of color are often not socially permitted to have? #emotional-labor

Give from your overflow. You can't help someone if you have no spoons / running on empty.

> I have to be cautious about using #emdr with the people that I have not built a rapport with and so even with the culture of African Americans and *southern* African Americans you can't do stuff that they be like is this witchcraft? like what you're trying to do? is this some type of get out and so we have to be more creative and be comfortable being creative also making sure that we maintain confidentiality and that we are cautious about ethical dilemmas and I just think that it's something that's different for our culture that we have to be willing to find ways to work through to make sure that people get the things that they need so that they feel like their investment in therapy is definitely an investment in their future.

#emdr can be triggering for some people, especially people of color who have had a history of medical experimentation inflicted upon them. #emdr

When I start my program, it will be important to network with other therapist who are not like me. People of color, female, trans, straight, etc.
