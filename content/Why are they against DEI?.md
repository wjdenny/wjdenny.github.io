I want to get at the bottom of why people are against DEI. Both why the right-wing media is *actually* against it, and why conservatives in general are easily going along with it. 

This idea started when I read that the DEI chief at Johns Hopkins, Sherita Golden, resigned after she shared her definition of privilege in an organization newsletter. There was outrage, similar to the one that got that Kirkwood adjunct fired. But the definition she shared wasn't anything hateful. Seems fucking ridiculous. 

I also would like to know why she resigned. She also apologized and retracted her definition. Why? Maybe it could have been worded better (I'm also interested in what that would look like), but it was by no means what the morons outraged are claiming. 

Anyway, for now I just want this out of my brain and somewhere I can come back to later.

https://www.wmar2news.com/local/johns-hopkins-chief-diversity-officer-stepping-down-following-controversial-remarks-in-january -- people calling her message "racist"; let's work on a definition of racism.

I think Sara Ahmed's book might be relevant here, too. I think the thesis of it was how DEI programs often miss the point. *On Being Included: Racism and Diversity in Institutional Life*

Maybe related to "them" also not wanting minorities to vote (maybe even just African-Americans); also maybe related to literally everything else they want to do; ban gay marriage, ban abortion, etc.

The worldview they paint is a strict ~~hierarchy~~ white supremacist patriarchy. I need a bigger compound word, because this hierarchy would also place Christianity and being able-bodied at the top of the list.  Maybe that's why they're called fascists ffs.

I want to better understand the whole history of fascism. Did it really go away after WW2? Obviously not, but like, where did it go? Where did the surviving Nazis go? Argentina?
