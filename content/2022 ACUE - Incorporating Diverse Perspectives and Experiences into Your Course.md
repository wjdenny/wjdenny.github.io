I think it's incredibly important that students have the opportunity to see themselves and their experiences represented in courses, and that representation can take different forms. It can take the form of being an instructor in a class. It can take the form of introducing them to authors and scholars and readings that present different voices and experiences and perspectives. And it can take the form in guest lectures.

For years, the basis of most of our disciplines, and certainly science, has been brought about the pictures that we see about who the scientists are and the major discoveries. They are White males and that's what we know about them. 

## Adannaa O. Alexander; Clinical Assistant Professor; Department of Population Health/College of Health Sciences; Sam Houston State University [00:00:50]
When we look at things from only one perspective. For example, let's just say, you know, the dominant culture of the White European perspective, we miss all of those stories and those other perspectives of Native peoples, for example, Black people who were brought over as slaves, right? And in all of these other areas that also have a story. 

## Kristina Ruiz-Mesa, PhD [00:01:11]
I think it's important that students have the opportunity to hear from multiple people in the time that a course takes. So, whether that hearing of people comes from different guest lectures, whether it comes from readings, whether it comes from examples, it's recognizing that I am not all things to all people at all times. And that's OK, because I will work to make sure that my students get different voices and perspectives and hear different interpretations of material. 

## Salvador, Student; California State University, Los Angeles [00:01:37]
As a Latino student, one of the things I'm really excited about is to read Latino authors and to see some of the contributions we've made in literature and research in general. And so, I really felt like she was really catering some of that reading to me and just getting it really excited to learn about some of the course material. 

## Beck A. Munsey, PhD, NCC, LPC-S; Department Head & Associate Professor; Department of Counseling; Tarleton State University [00:01:57]
One thing that our department does is that we have students review our syllabi before we, after each semester. And so, a lot of times we make sure that our student population is reviewing our, our syllabi for our program or also from diverse voices, you know, diversity in culture, diversity in ethnicity, diversity in age. I want to hear perspectives from students and how to make my syllabus more inclusive of their identities. 

## Kate Kelley, PhD; Director of Undergraduate Studies; Department of Religious Studies; University of Missouri [00:02:29]
In my reading list on my syllabus, I include photographs of the authors of what students are reading. I do that for a couple of reasons. First, that I want people to know who they're learning from. But I also talk about it explicitly, for instance. So, this is from this person's point of view, maybe it's a Black woman and she's writing about race. And how do you think that that might compare to, for instance, another reading that I use from a White woman, she's a historian talking about race. And so, it's really interesting to get into these conversations about positionally and identity and what kind of knowledge is formed and generated from people's identities, depending on how the world has treated them, how they see themselves in the world. 

## Tessi, Student; University of Missouri [00:03:17]
One thing that I've noticed about myself is that I tend to assume that authors share a race or racial identity with myself without knowing anything about them. That's like my default assumption. And so, when I'm presented with a list that includes their, like their names, a little bit of their bio and then also an image of them, then I found myself often surprised that there was more diversity in the readings than I expected. And it allowed me to, to know that the author was coming from a just a bit of a different perspective than I was or that I might have assumed that they were. 

## Adannaa O. Alexander [00:03:52]
So, one thing that I like to do is I like to bring in guest speakers so that my students can learn about our field from different and diverse perspectives. So, for example, I've brought in a mentor of mine who is a Black woman that is working in Oregon on a college campus addressing alcohol and drug issues, for example. I had reached out to a contact of mine who's deaf, and I plan on doing something with her within the same multicultural health class where we talk about non ethnic cultures. So, I want my students to not only see themselves potentially in the guest speakers that I bring, but also know that there are others that don't look like them that are also doing important work. 

## Santiba D. Campbell, PhD; Associate Professor, Psychology; Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences; Bennett College [00:04:34]
When you teach history in the systems of psychology, this is a while before women show up in a textbook or women in a dominant role, not the supportive character, right? But this is the person doing the research. So, oftentimes I'll bring you video clips or outside articles are one of my favorite things I like to do is current people in the field so they can see people that look like them and also realize that psychology is a young science that's ever evolving. 

## Beck A. Munsey, PhD [00:05:02]
I can't necessarily find a research article or textbook written in a diverse voice, then I may pull like a YouTube or a TED Talk that has a diverse voice talking about the same topic, but in a different way and a different perspective. I think that's really important because our mental health field is traditionally been White male, you know, of European descent. And so, I think it's really important that we break free of that stereotype and how different concepts may affect different communities in our society and really making sure students are hearing that and seeing that, too, is really important to me. 

## Darvelle Hutchins, PhD; Doctoral Candidate; Department of Communication; University of Missouri [00:05:42]
I also acknowledge that students have their own collection of individuals that they read, whether it be in leisure or whether it be an academic book. And so, I ask students, you know, who are some of the people that you like to read? You know, when you're thinking about diversity and inclusion or social justice, you know what names come to mind. It's important for them to feel that they can relate to the force, that they can take some of those readings and they can tie it in in a way that enhances their own learning. 

## Colwayne, Student; University of Missouri [00:06:09]
It is very important for students to hear from a diverse group of scholars, especially within their field. It makes them feel welcoming or belonging within field and make them feel, oh, I see someone that looks like me or acts like me or dresses like me within this field. I can probably do it. 
 
## Kristina Ruiz-Mesa, PhD [00:06:39]
Examples are an incredible tool that we have as educators sometimes the way that we explain a concept, or a theory may not resonate with our students. Sometimes someone else's words, someone else's framing or example is going to work better. And I think that a part of being a really effective communicator and educator is being current. And that means what are my students watching? What are they listening to? And I can tell you, I have broadened my television watching, my Netflix watching, my YouTube watching, my music listening. And so, I have to recognize that the examples that are available to me are broad, and I need to use my resources. 

## Kelly A. Hogan, PhD [00:07:17]
Finding materials that really represent the diversity of a discipline can be a challenge. We have to do some digging. We have to search for them. One of the places that I find a lot of ideas is through social media. So, for example, on Twitter, there are hashtags that trend. One of these is \#BlackInSTEM, and now there are subsets of this \#BlackInNeuro \#BlackInChem. This is a place where I'm starting to find living scientists, contributing a lot of great information and knowledge to the world, but not always getting the recognition. And there's no reason I can't bring their science into my classroom. 

## Kristina Ruiz-Mesa, PhD [00:07:54]
Social media is an incredible tool for getting ourselves into spaces of inclusive pedagogy, of diverse scholars, of understanding different ideas, perspectives, applications of theories that we may not have traditionally seen published in our large journals. 

## Melissa, Student; California State University, Los Angeles [00:08:11]
Dr. Ruiz-Mesa has always incorporated identities of all types and backgrounds, and it is very important for students like us because we are able to see ourselves as scholars and that we can achieve the same things that the author is that Dr. Ruiz-Mesa has exposed us to. We can achieve the same status and achievements and accomplishment as them. 

## Katherine McCarthy, PhD, LCSW; Assistant Professor; Indiana University School of Social Work [00:08:34]
I teach a lot of theory and practice, and so we're always using cases, situations of people to try to understand how we can assist the social workers. So, I think using cases, using clients that reflect a diverse society, that reflect different background, marital status, color, ethnicity, gender is really important because as social workers, we are working with people from all different backgrounds. And I want to normalize that not every client is going to be a White middle- class individual, that a lot of our clients will have all sorts of backgrounds. 

## Peyton, Student; Indiana University School of Social Work [00:09:11]
I think that it's very important for professors to do this because if the professor doesn't do this, there's always going to be at least one person in that class that doesn't feel connected to the course material. That could be if somebody is a marginalized group, maybe they're African-American, maybe they're a lesbian, maybe they've been adopted. It's very important to kind of get all of those different cultural factors because that way that person can feel connected. 

## Kristina Ruiz-Mesa, PhD [00:09:41]
When thinking about course readings, we often go back to how we were taught, what were the theories, the theorists, the concepts that are part of our disciplinary canon that are must reads for our classes and challenging that and saying, are there people who are excluded from this list? Are there emerging scholars who are doing really amazing work, who aren't getting included? 

## Beck A. Munsey, PhD [00:10:01]
So, I think it is important that we acknowledge that, hey, there's no diversity on this. You know, I couldn't find in the last 10 years any diversity on this particular concept in our field. And, you know, being honest, that's what we need, right? It's also important to ask students, is there a voice that I missed this semester and being open to that feedback and if they have any suggestions on movies or suggestions on clips or, you know, those kinds of things helps make my course more enriched for the next semester. 

## Leticia, Student; Tarleton State University [00:10:32]
When we were looking at the counseling field, all of the counselors were old White men back in, a long time ago. And we're like, how does that apply to now and how does that apply to me? And it was interesting because Dr. Munsey did say, he had pointed that out, you know, these are old White men that did this. So, how to how, how can we take what they did when they were doing it back in the 50s or the 40s, and how can we make that work for you now, not being an old White man? And that was like, whoa, yeah, how can we? 

## Kelly A. Hogan, PhD [00:11:04]
The other thing that I think is important and less obvious, especially to students when we bring diversity into the curriculum, is the benefit of diversity to society. And I think we can think about this in a scientific way. If we look at something like women's reproductive issues and women's physiology, we don't know a lot about these topics. Why? Because the history of science has not been studied by women. And now that women are in there doing this kind of work, they're saying, hey, we need to learn these things. Women are now being represented, they're in Congress. They're, they're speaking up and saying we need to know the side effects on women, right? And that's just one small example of how society benefits when we have diverse people studying science. 

## Beck A. Munsey, PhD [00:11:51]
It also gets students excited about what they might be able to do and how they might be able to research in the future, too. If they see that, hey, there's a lack of diversity. I, I represent a piece of diversity and, you know, my voice isn't being heard and so, I want to go change that. And so, for example, you know, I was tired of there only being one chapter in every textbook about LGBTQI+ population and all the subpopulations there, one chapter. So, I decided to teach a whole course on it. And, you know, I'm always encouraging where we find a lack of research or we find a lack of a voice being represented, I tell my students that's, that's what that's there's the social justice piece. This is where we need to advocate for change in our field. 

## Marlene, Student; Tarleton State University [00:12:36]
He really advocates to show everyone that we're represented and to show that, hey, look, we're all accepted in this classroom and that we should advocate even further outside of the classroom. So, the power of him doing that just spreads even further into my life and into my future of being a counselor. 

## Kristina Ruiz-Mesa, PhD [00:12:59]
And so, thinking more broadly about how we can incorporate diverse voices, diverse experiences, and diverse examples is a great way for our students to feel that we are walking the walk and that we're talking the talk. That we are making sure that we are not just inclusive in how we are framing the class, but that our reading lists and that our assignments and our assessments are aligned with our values.
