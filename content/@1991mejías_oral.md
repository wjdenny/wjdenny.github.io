> The study collected normative data on communication apprehension for bilingual Mexican American high school and college students to establish a baseline for communication apprehensive studies on similar populations. Authors made a distinction between dominant and native language effects on communication apprehension to explain differences between Mexican American students and other Hispanic groups. They also confirmed other studies' data that predicts higher CA levels for females compared to males.

## Notes

> The U.S. Bureau of the Census classifies Hispanics as persons of Spanish origin or descent who designate themselves as Mexican American, Chicano, Puerto Rican, Cuban, and other/Spanish/Hispanic nationalities. Although tied together by a common cultural background-language and religion, these groups present distinct social-cultural and economic profiles (Ford Foundation, 1984; p. 6).

> The largest Hispanic group in the United States traces its origins to Mexico. Sixty percent of the 14.6 million Hispanics in the United States, excluding Puerto Ricans, are of Mexican origin (U.S. Bureau of the Census; Passel & Warren, 1983), with the majority of these individuals residing in the Southwestern United States. [page 87]

> One of the most significant factors affecting the education attainment of Hispanics is their sometimes limited English-language background and proficiency (Fligstein & Fernández, 1982; Durán, 1983). [page 87]

> Since most Mexican American students use two languages--English and Spanish-- with varying levels of proficiency and competence in education situations, they may experience communication apprehension or use their bilingualism to avoid educational situations in which they feel apprehensive (Krashen, 1981). [page 87]

> The term *communication apprehension* (CA) refers to an individual's level of fear or anxiety associated with either real or anticipated communication with another person or persons. More than all other learning disabilities combined, CA s said to affect the behavior of students, with over 20% of all students experiencing high levels of CA (Hurt, Scott, & McCroskey, 1978; McCroskey, 1970, 1977a, 1982a). [page 88]

> When students use two languages, they may avoid situations in which they must function in a language with which they feel apprehensive. Non-native English speakers who are apprehensive in English, then, tend to avoid sitautions in which they are called upon to fuction in English (Allen, O'Mara, & Andriate, 1984a). [page 88]

> This apprehension in the second language, moreover, is usually somehow related to apprehensiveness in the primary language (Fayer, McCroskey, & Richmond, 1984; McCroskey, Fayer, & Richmond, 1983). [page 88]

> Both versions of the PRCA-24 were administered in English. [page 89]

This chapter includes the full list of questions for both the PRCA-24 and PRCA-10.

The study also looked at gender differences among Mexican-American students. I think it could easily be more complex with this, with interactions between gender and age as well.

> Research has repeatedly shown that bilingual, non-naive students in the United States similarly experience less CA in their native language than in English when the native languages were the dominant language for those subjects. For the Mexican American subjects in our study, however, English was the dominant, although not necessarily the native, language; thus, relative CA levels found int his study were in fact consistent with data from previously studied bilingual populations [page 94].

The sample in this study had lower levels of CA in English than other studies' samples of other Latin American students. The authors explain this as that even though Spanish is the native language of both populations, English is the dominant language of the Mexican Americans as opposed to Spanish being also the dominant language for Puerto Rican students.

I'm not quite sure I understand or believe this, though the distinction between native and dominant language seems interesting.

> Although CA values differ significantly across cultures and in a variety of contexts, the communication norms of a specific culture will dictate whether the CA level is a problem. If an individual were to have a CA level exceeding the norm, it might hinder the individual's ability to interact with others of the same culture. For example, if a Mexican American experiences high CA in dyadic classroom situations, CA might create a barrier to normal classroom interaction, and the individual's failure to behave as expected might be perceived negatively by other communicators, including teachers and school administrators. [page 95]

The population norming is important because it helps us understand the meaning of an individual's CA score. If the number is high, we need the norming to understand whether it is high relative to the student's native culture, or high relative to the classroom culture. This adds a level of complexity; if I were to get PRCA scores of an entire ELA class, should I consider the whole sample as a "culture" and be looking for outliers, or consider the normative data for each students' cultural background?

> While it has been suggested that CA is an affective response and, thus, may e unrelated to the performance skills (proficiency) of an individual, it is possible also that one factor underlying students' proficiency evaluations is their perception of their oral performance in specific contexts. This perception, moreover, may be shaped in part by th e students' CA levels [page 95].

> This study, like previous studies of bilingual college students, found significant positive correlations between subjects' CA in the two languages. Previous research has suggested that CA is a trait that can be generalized across both languages for bilinguals, in the sense that CA in a second language is best predicted by CA in a dominant or native language. If we assume that CA in a second language is thus related to CA in the dominant language, the findings of this study may suggest that reducing CA in the dominant language may also reduce CA in the second language [page 95].

Communication apprehension in a second language is highly correlated with communication apprehension in a person's first language.

> Since silence is rewarded by certain teachers and actually demanded in certain learning activities, the student with high CA is apt to perceive silence as a desirable response to classroom activities, and in this way the behavior is reinforced. Asa  result, rather than coping with the problem of communication apprehension, students would avoid confronting their fear of communicating in the classroom situation [page 96].

> Such avoidance in the learning environment could of course involve a complex interaction with other factors. For instance, a lack of proficiency or understanding of the course content by the student-- e.g., solving quadratic equations in algebra-- could interact with an aversion to ask questions, resulting form high CA. Such a student might be unwilling or unable to request the necessary clarification of content tor to acquire the skills needed for learning the course concept. 

I think this is what's going on with a lot of our African students. I'd suspect the CA norm for Sudanese students, for example, is much lower than American students. This leads to these students not asking for help when they don't understand something, or communicating with their instructors when they need to reschedule something, thus leading to a lot of poorly learned material and missed exams.
