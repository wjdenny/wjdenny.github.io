Students with diverse cultural backgrounds often do not feel that copying or cheating is a problem. They may even feel that it is expected behavior.

[[Many rhetorical prohibitions in the standard academic English curriculum are effective rhetorical tools]]

[[The dominant narrative of multilingual students is deficit-based]] but these cultures have a different, but rich, legacy of education in their own right.

[[Reading was a communal activity and recitation of common ideas was the norm]]

Like most cultural behavior, [[Peer behavior was found to be a major predictor of student cheating]]

[[Rubrics reduce students' uncertainty in grading]] It may be worth putting plagiarism on the rubric.

This could be a feature of high-context cultures; in that if there is a high level of shared knowledge, there is less reason to cite individual authors.
