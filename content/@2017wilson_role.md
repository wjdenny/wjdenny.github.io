> [!summary] Summary
> Wilson studies the social networks of linguistically diverse high school students and the ways those networks supported or hindered literacy skills.
## Notes
> Using the lenses of social support and social network theory [page 63]

> **The underlying principle of *social network theory* is that interpersonal relationships-- and the patterns formed by these relations-- are the building blocks of social life** (Marin & Wellman, 2011). [page 64]

> An early proponent of social network analysis in language research was socio-linguist Lesley Milroy, who studied patterns of linguistic variation as related to individuals' ties to their local communities in Belfast, Ireland, in the 1970s and '80s (e.g., Milroy, 1987). [page 64]

> However, Milroy applied a whole network approach, in which a researcher takes a "bird's eye view" (Marin & Wellman, 2011, p. 19) of all members in a network and the connections between them. In contrast, I have used the personal network approach, which focuses only on a single individual and the links between this individual and others. [page 64]

> ***social support* research, which "pursue[s] a wide range of questions concerning the positive (and negative) outcomes that people receive from social relationships"** (Morgan, 1990, p. 195). [page 64]

> In more recent years, researchers from a variety of fields have studied the effects of social support on depression, delinquency, and academic performance in children (Richman, Roisenfeld, & Bowen, 1998). [page 64]

> Over three decades of research, social psychologists have confirmed that the people perceived by students to be supportive fall into five distinct categories: parent, teacher, classmate, close friend, and school personnel (cf. Malecki & Demaray, 2006). [page 64]

> In her three-year study of four university students from whom English was not the first language, **Leki (2007) found that the academic success of these students was often based on the academic literacy support-- such as shared lecture notes, informal study groups, and mentoring-- they received via relationships they had established with their classmates and their instructors.** [page 64]

> **second study (Snow, Porsche, Tabors, & Harris, 2007) followed 41 low-income students from age 3 through 10th grade and concluded that "[t]he poorer academic outcomes of the students highlighted ... compared with those in the group who fared better has much to do with the availability of supportive adults in general, and strong parental support in particular" (p. 66)** [page 64--65]

> As I have described elsewhere (Wilson, 2013), a variety of qualitative studies of multilingual adolescents' writing (and reading) demonstrate the many contexts in which these students are interacting through literate activities with important people in their lives. Such contexts and activities include emailing a parent living abroad, chatting with friends on the Internet, and composing creative pieces online (Yi, 2007); working with a partner to compose a group project for school (Villalva, 2006); chatting online with peers around the world (Lam, 2000); negotiating conflict with an English teacher (Ortmeier-Hooper, 2013); and relying on a teacher to compose a course paper (Kibler, 2013). [page 65]

> Taken as a body of work, however, **the contexts in which such relationships have been described by second language writing (SLW) researchers correlate with the categories of supportive individuals described by social support researchers (e.g., Melecki & Demaray, 2006): adolescents have substantial *socioliterate relationships* with parents, teachers, friends, and, to a lesser degree, classmates.** [page 65]

> The concept of socioliterate relationships in my research evolved from Leki's (2007) use of **the term =="socioacademic relationships" to denote social interactions between multilingual undergraduates and their peers and faculty== members "that proved to be critical to the students' sense of satisfaction with their educational work and sometimes even to the possibility of doing that work" (p. 14).** [page 65]

These relationships are crucial for marginalized student success, but not accounted for in faculty compensation or valuation; see: [emotional labor](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DpM1sGxZV2MhBXdPVO-XZzaAzo1ct8dBWjVWaVv91wI/edit#slide=id.g276bbfd5d2_0_4), adjuncts, female teachers, stopping, teachers of color.

> One factor in this marked preference for English among these multilingual participants in this study may be related to findings by Jia and Aaronson (2003) that L1 attrition was occurring by the time students had been in the United States for 36 months, and that attrition was most severe in students' reading and writing [page 67]

> Participants' fairly low scores on the Sight Work Efficiency and Phonemic Decoding Efficiency subtests of the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (Wagner, Torgesen, & Rashotte, 1999), completed as screening measuring for the ALTUR project, confirm their struggles in reading and writing (Table 5.2) [page 67]

> In the social network protocol, the students were asked to identify all individuals in five domains of their social network: home, other family, school, friends, outside of school. In addition, the students were asked to identify up to 10 of these individuals who were "most important" to them. The students were then asked specifically about their reading and writing interactions with these 10 individuals as well as how often and in what ways they talked to these 10 individuals about their future plans. [page 68]

> Analysis consisted of writing individual case studies and comparing across cases (Miles & Huberman, 1994; Stake, 2006). [page 68]

> (for more details, see WIlson, 2012) [page 68]

> about 10 months after the main data collection had concluded, I conducted member check interviews with each participant, during which the participant and I read together the relevant case report, and the participant corrected inaccurate or missing information. [page 68]

> Unsurprisingly, considering the premium placed on friendships in adolescence, participants' *friend* relationships were reported to be very important in their lives. Indeed, the percentage of *friend* contacts was the highest among all network domains, for both the general networks and the "most important" contacts. [page 68]

> Also salient was the relatively large number of network members located in the *other family* domain; this domain was essentially the same size as the *home* domain. [page 69]

> Echoing the findings of a contemporaneous Pew Internet report that email is "losing its luster" as teens gravitate towards tools that allow synchronous communication (Lenhart, Madden, Macgill, & Smith, 2007, p. 20), MSN was Acer's preferred method of communication. [page 70]

> Just over half of the reported writing support came from individuals in the *school* domain ($n$ = 45 instances); further analysis identified that 36 instances were reported from English teachers, compared to 3 from classmates and 6 from teachers in classes other than English/language arts. Indeed, **English teachers were the single most-cited source of support for writing, accounting for 43% of the total reported instances.** [page 72--73]

Perhaps this is why we don't see a lot of English and ELA faculty taking overloads?

> In my personal experience as P2E tutor, I found that many of the students did not understand a teacher's written instructions for an assignment prompt and they benefited greatly when their tutors modeled this skill. [page 74]

> In most cases, the support consisted of network members (1) encouraging these teens to go to college or to pursue a specific career or (2) giving advice about college entrance requirements (course selection, grades, or admission paperwork). [page 74]

> In comparison to their importance in other facets of these adolescent's lives, friends were notably absent from or uninfluential in the discussion of future plans. [page 75]

> Negative social support is an acknowledge, though little studied, phenomenon in the field of social support. ... **Hirsch (1985), a leading scholar in social network and support, termed this phenomenon "social rejection" (p. 121)** in order to contrast it with social support, and he linked its relevance to its impact on "our social identities in major spheres of life" (p. 119). [page 76]

> As Moje, Oversby, Tysvaer, and Morris (2008) asserted, "youth read and write when they have a well-articulated purpose, a purpose that is usually centered in a network of social activity" (p. 146). [page 77]

I think this is true of all types of learning; see: Unschooling movement

> The very act of completing a social network map often revealed supportive relationships that the clients had not initially recognized. The women were coached about how to ask for assistance from these resources, and social workers believed the network map activity was empowering for many of these mothers. Likewise, when teachers or administrators are talking to students who are struggling with literacy events or practices, they could help students think about who in their social networks might be able to help them with particular writing tasks, practices, or situations. [page 77]

[[Students can benefit from taking the time to map out their socioacademic support networks and being coached on how to ask those resources for help.]]

> What do spaces that promote socioliterate interactions and support look like? They may resemble after-school programs like Digital Underground Storytelling for Youth in Oakland and Voices, Inc., in Tuscon, where young people are apprenticed into literacy events with real-world applications, often mentored by peers who look and speak like them (Rubinstein-Ávila, 2007). They may be classrooms with an established system of teacher-student writing conferences (e.g., Sperling, 1991), journal writing (cf. Fu, 1995), or collaborative writing (e.g., Rish & Caton, 2011), or other teacher practices that build a general sense of trust, such as reaching out when a student needs additional help or is struggling in class (Ivey & Broaddus, 2000) or simply getting to know students' lives outside the classroom (Langer, 2002). Such a safe space could be located in cyberspace as well, like the social site Welcome to Buckeye City (Yi, 2007), used by Korean teens in a midwestern U.S. city to write texts such as comics, poems, and reviews. [page 77--78]

> Supportive spaces are also ones that welcome teens as active and equal participants who are voicing their own needs, concerns, and interests, instead of trying to guide or even force adolescents into an expected model of learning or writing. [...] no participants reported specific socioliterate interactions with an SPSW [(Student Parent Support Worker)], even when asked directly about their SPSWs in member check interviews. Perhaps these positions are configured on a deficit model that these teens were subconsciously resisting-- would teens respond better to adults whom they have identified as support figures, thereby exercising their own agency, rather than adults who have been thrust upon them in some manner? Thus, it is important for program administrators to recognize that it is not enough to make such support available to students but that individuals in these positions have to (1) continuously reach out to students and (2) find ways to engage students as "active participants" (Lesko, 2001). This advice holds true, as well, for individuals providing support for the transition from high school to college. [page 78]

Academic support programs often approach students with a deficit mindset. Students often resist deficit-based support. Academic support interventions should give students the space to articulate their needs.

> A final relevant point raised by this study is that after-school programs focused on helping students graduate from high school need to help successful graduates find similar services in postsecondary education. Providing "at-risk" high school students with tutors for several years, only to yank that support out from under their feet when they need it most-- at college-- sets them up for failure. Instead, these programs should provide their students with tangible descriptions and examples of the ways in which postsecondary writing assignments will differ from those in high school. They also need to make concrete, practical suggestions for *places*-- such as college writing centers, peer tutors, academic advising offices-- and *ways*-- like making regular appointments with TAs or instructors-- to seek out socioliterate support. [page 78--79]

Linguistic minority high school students need to be supported through the transition from high school to college. Specifically, they need to be coached on academic support resources available to them in college and be better prepared for the ways in which college assignments differ from high school assignments.
