## Notes
[[A 'plan of possibilities' is an alternative to the concept of a daily lesson plan]]

re: Darlene the darlingmusicteacher post about expecting free labor from teachers; lesson plans copy/pasted from online are not one-size-fits-all.

[[Using longer-term projects rather than individual activities in a class has a number of benefits]]

The way we plan our classes has a big impact on what happens in the classroom and how it happens.
