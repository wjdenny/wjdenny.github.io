# MOCs & Idea Emergence: A discussion w/ Nick Milo and his LYT framework for Obsidian

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf830yZf0x0)

> [!summary] Summary

## Notes
[[Nick Milo]] was the guest, he is an [[Obsidian Forum]] moderator and creator of LYT ([[Linking Your Thinking]]).

> The [[Zettlekasten]] culture was based on atomic notes.

[[Nick Milo|Milo]] wanted to organize his atomic notes under an outline and so developed the [[Map of Content]].

[[Map of Content]] are similar to a table of contents, but more fluid. The idea was created by someone else.. Quixotic How to keep track of everything

> Are we collecting notes or making notes?

Similar to [[Tiago Forte]], he argues for making notes productive.

Literature notes is the "traditional nomenclature" for my research source notes.
[[Andy Matuschak]] uses something called a [[Speculative Outline]] as he reads a source. I imagine this gives you more of a focus on what the author is saying, rather than what you're getting from the source.

[[Links are cheap and do not need to be fleshed out immediately.]]

- Different levels of emergence
	- Level 1
		- new idea solidify into unique notes from the collection of literature notes in your collection. aka [[Atomic Notes]], and these are ideas without structure.
		- divergence, emergence, and convergence
			- no clear perspective, but ideas start to change
			- hairs are split, long notes are split; some ideas come together, etc.
			- some atomic notes start to become "evergreen"; a more connected network of atomic notes
	- Level 2
		- well connected notes, but no birds eye view (no MOC)

Level 3
higher order notes, MOCs, connect the notes together and give them some structure and order.
assembling phase; gather atomic notes together
colliding phase; notes interact, weak or strong points are identified and updated
unifying phase clear organization and grouping

Level 4
> Now the notes are not talking to each other, the maps are talking to each other.

Level 5
a map of the map of contents; "Home"
