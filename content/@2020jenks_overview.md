> [!summary] Summary
> - You can do a global search of headings using `[[##` when autocompleting links.
- You can do a global search of blocks using `[[^` when autocompleting links.
- You can rename block-level references to (almost) whatever you like.
- Block-level references can be tables, images, iframes, anything.
- Ripgrep seems like a useful command-line tool; grep is complicated; aliases might also help.
- Block references are not standard Markdown, and won't play nice with most Markdown interpreters.
