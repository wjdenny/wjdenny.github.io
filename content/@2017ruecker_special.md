## Notes
> From 2000 to 2013, the percentage of minority students in rural schools rose from 16.4% to 26.7%. The percentage of students officially classified as English language learners (ELLs) doubled. Approximately 2.6 million minority (not necessarily language minority) students and over 300,000 students classified as ELL are now attending rural schools (Johnson et al., 2014). [page 82]

[[The increasing numbers of immigrants is not limited to major metropolitan areas, but is also increasing in smaller towns and rural areas as well]]

> Sulzberger (2011) explored how Latina/o immigrants, often drawn by jobs in meatpacking and other occupations undesirable to native-born U.S. workers, are changing the face of traditionally dying tows in the plains states. [page 82]

One of the factors that bring transnational workers to rural areas of the US is the availability of unfilled jobs.

> this chapter explores the increasing diversity of rural schools, identifies the challenges facing these schools in preparing increasingly diverse student populations for college, and calls for more research on language diversity in rural schools. [page 82]

> In 2000, the Rural School and Community Trust released the first in a series of biannual reports titled *Why Rural Matters (WRM)*. [page 82]

> The rural ELL population, while growing, has been doubly marginalized by both the lack of research on rural schools and the invisibility of this particular population in the limited research on rural contexts. This is in part because the shift is relatively recent. While it has been happening for a few decades, the magnitude of demographic shifts in rural communities was not fully seen until the 2010 census (Sulzberger, 2011). [page 83]

Demographic changes in rural schools has gone largely unnoticed outside of rural areas. This leads to an issue where students are underrepresented within an underrepresented institution.

>"Rural schools face challenges associated with factors other than poverty, including students with disabilities, students who cannot speak English well, and minority students disadvantaged by generations of racial and ethnic discrimination" (Johnson & Strange, 2005, p. v). [page 83]

If ethnic and linguistic minority students do manage to succeed in school despite this, they may end up leaving these rural areas for more community in bigger cities. This could drive critical support away from remaining individuals.

> "Rapid growth in English Language Learner student populations and lack of access to ELL training programs for teachers has left many rural schools and districts without qualified staff" (p. vii). [page 83]

> A number of researchers have noted the difficulty attracting teachers to and keeping them at rural schools, in part because of the gravitation toward urban areas as well as salary disparities (Johnson & Strange, 2007). [page 84]

> Given the shortage of TESOL- and/or bilingual-certified teachers in most states (ED, 2015), it is especially hard for rural schools to recruit the teachers necessary to support their students' language needs, whether in learning English or building bi-literacy through a dual language program. A lack of teachers qualified to work effectively with ELLs means these students may be more likely to face a sink-or-swim environment in rural schools. [page 84]

Rural schools lack qualified staff to support linguistic minority students due to sudden changes in demographics and inability to attract qualified staff and administrators. This has a negative effect on the development of students' language skills and attitudes towards education.

> they introduced a measure for "Percentage of the population age 5 or older who speak English 'less than very well,'" noting that this was 2.4% of rural students nationwide, with this number highest in New Mexico at 14%, followed by Arizona at 12% (p. 8). They explained that **methods exist for serving this population but that "they require dedicated school staff and the support of policymakers"** (p. 8). [page 83]

There are methods to properly serve linguistic minority students but they require administrative support.

> They began by giving the readers a sense of this change, noting that ELL enrollment in rural schools more than doubled between 1989-90 and 2004-05, a rate "more than seven times higher than the rate of increase for total student enrollment" (p. 25). [page 83]

Linguistic minority students with low quality secondary education will be making their way to colleges in these areas for some time.

> rural schools are often spread out and remote, meaning they cannot share support resources like urban/suburban schools. [page 83]

> research on rural schools is limited compared to research on schools in more urban or suburban areas (Arnold et al., 2005; Coladarci, 2007). [page 84]

This might be similar to WEIRD studies and the tendency of scholars to stay close to their own demographic; in this case, urban and suburban.

 > As they do with teachers, rural schools also have a difficult time recruiting and retaining administrators. In rural areas, this is often connected to politics surrounding local administration and school boards (e.g., Howley & Harmon, 2000), but it is often something that connects to broader accountability moves that make careers in education less desirable, whether as a teacher or administrator. [page 84]

Are there ways to support students outside the education system?

 > Strong administrators can make a huge difference in the lives of ELL students because they tend to be the ones applying for grants to fund necessary services or unique programs that can support their students. They also make resources decisions like the need for a district-level bilingual education coordinator. [page 84]

What grants are available?

> With the arrival of No Child Left Behind, schools were required to provide supplementary educational services (SESs) to particular groups of students, such as ELLs and special education students. [page 84]

Is this why ELL and Special Education often get lumped together?

> special burden on rural schools, where students needing these services are not as concentrated as in urban schools (Barley & Wegner, 2010). Rural schools are often home to a number of transient student populations, including children of migrant farmworkers (Bustamante, Brown, & Irby, 2010). Consequently, schools may be hesitant to provide services for students who may leave after a few months (and take the funding associated with their ELL label with them). [page 84--84]

> lower population density ... high prevalence of untaxed federal and state land. [page 85]

> assessments have the tendency to ignore local cultures and push a remedial curriculum on schools that serve large percentages of ELL students (Ruecker, 2013; Ruecker, Chamcharatsri, & Saengngoen, 2015). [page 85]

> Donehower, Hogg, and Schell (2007) expressed concerns over standardization movements representing a white, suburban middle-class norm with limited representation of the experiences of rural communities. This means that ELL students in rural schools maybe even further removed culturally from these assessments. [page 85]

[[School assessments tend to be designed to measure learning of the dominant majority]]

> students coming from rural schools are less likely to get an A or B in a first-year writing class than their urban counterparts. [page 85]

> more likely to withdraw, representing 36% of the overall FYW population but 47% of the population that ends up with Ws in their FYW class. [page 86]

> rural students in our state are disproportionately Native American, and may tend to attend branch campuses closer to home, where dropout rates in FYW classes commonly exceed 50%. [page 86]

> Theories of cultural ecologies, first developed in writing studies by Cooper (1986), are particularly useful in helping me understand each student story within a larger ecological context. Cooper (1986) explained that this ecological model is based on the notion that "writing is an activity through which a person is continually engaged with a variety of socially constituted systems" (p. 367). As argued elsewhere (e.,g., Ortmeier-Hooper & Enright, 2011; Ruecker, 2015), literacy and literacy instruction takes place in a larger network of interconnected systems, with broader issues such as policies pushing high-stakes assessment and ongoing systemic inequalities in society impacting individual students and teachers at the classroom level. [page 86--87]

> Even though the majority of students at the school were Latina/o there was still a bit of hierarchy between Latina/o students and newly arrived students from Mexico, with the former tracing their lineage back to Spanish colonizers and some viewing Mexicans and Mexican culture negatively. [page 88]

> While I had intended to continue playing a relatively passive observer role in the class, I was a bit disturbed ... I taught most classes for the rest of my time on-site, focusing on reading texts matched to the students' levels along with reading from their history class and discussing them while focusing on pertinent vocabulary. It was my hope that the teacher would get more ideas about instruction through these different activities, and she was very open to it. [page 90]

> While the SBA was provided in Spanish for Miguel, the school had no idea if the test was available for Liang to take in Chinese (it was not) or otherwise how to support him in taking it (such as providing a translator, for instance). Consequently, he seemed to be held to a different standard than an immigrant student from Mexico who comes from a demongraphic more traditionally represented at the school. [page 91]

[[Efforts to support one group of student can further marginalize others.]]

> I thought about recommending him intensive ESL classes at a local college but learned that the college administration had recently cut the ESL program amid budget challenges and a transformation from a community college to a regional university. [page 91]

> As rural ELL student populations continue to grow, it is important that researchers in a variety of fields begin exploring how these populations are being served by their schools. [page 91]

Maybe pessimistic, but how does any of this research translate into policy? funding? training? See conversation w. partner:

> Research paper usually talks about what the problems are and causes of them. And policy brief or op eds are the ones that suggest actual possible solutions

Maybe a common assumption is that policymakers are looking to research articles to identify problems for them to work on, but I'm not confident that is actually the case.

> The case studies presented in this chapter revealed a largely sink-or-swim model in place at LHS with no coordinated bilingual or language education at the district model, even in a district with a history of diverse student populations. [page 91]

> With the arrival of the new Common Core-aligned exam, the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC), this disparity does not seem to be going away. While the math portion of the exam is going to be offered in Spanish, there has not been mention of a version in Chinese or other languages, with the exception of translation of test instructions (PARCC, 2015).  [page 92]

[[Efforts to support one group of student can further marginalize others.]]

AI translation might be offered as a cheaper alternative to translating exams, but I expect that will be disastrous, see: issues with AI

> While completing this work, it is essential that researchers continue to develop ways to affect change in the world around them. Our society is rife with inequality, and the "cycle of inopportunity" that Ortmeier-Hooper and Enright (2011) reference does not only refer to disparities in curricular opportunities but broader inequities as well. [page 93]

> All names, including the high school, are pseudonyms. This project received IRB approval from relevant bodies. [page 93]

> Title III refers to federally funded support for ELLs. Schools receive supplementary funding to support ELLs as long as they can show they are providing some support for these students. [page 93]
