> > What if leadership at work wasn't for a select few, but rather shared among many? Management consultant Gitte Frederiksen gives us the recipe for "distributed leadership" -- dynamic, multidimensional networks of leaders that tap into everyone's knowledge and creativity -- and shows how it allows teams to do more and do it better.

## Notes
> A typical view of leadership is a hierarchical organization chart. Either you're a leader or you're not. Most people are being led, not taking lead. Communication often flows from top to bottom along just one line, which means it doesn't match the complexity of problems which move in several directions at once. Decisions are left to one person, the leader who, being only human, can become a bottleneck of speed and scale.

[[Innovation and adaptation can become blocked by traditional leadership strategies]]

> They can miss new ideas, diverse capabilities, and potential that exist all over the chart. So in a network instead, everyone's in charge. And we replace power of the few with influence of the many. Short looks more messy, but I'd argue more beautiful, more multidimensional, more dynamic, more like nature. I believe this model can help us do more and be less dependent on each individual, which means it's resilient and progress is sustainable. To empower many more to lead, to move leadership from the few to the many, we each need to let go of a bit of power.

> Labels take many forms and shapes like functions, titles, genders, naturalities, educational backgrounds. They are everywhere and help us recognize things. And sometimes we even work hard to get that label, so they are comfortable. But labels come with a high cost of boxing people in not enabling us to go outside those boxes. We need to think about diverse skill sets and perspectives as we set teams. But once we have, what if we for a second forgot who's from marketing or who's the data scientist or who's the leader? I've at least been amazed by surprising capabilities in our teams.

> Share everything. We've learned to share a lot of things like rides, scooters, even our homes. But when it comes to work, we so often end up sitting on information and resources for ourselves.

[[Sharing your resources with the organization as a whole and not just your supervisor is a step towards distributed leadership]]

> This is leadership. Not in the hierarchical sense, but in the sense of taking lead for solving a problem by listing questions and involving people. Leadership is not about giving answers. It is asking the questions. It is daring to show vulnerability. Information is power. And information is everything like questions. But also data, context, emerging insights, work in progress, even water cooler conversations.

> People are much more likely to do things if they feel a sense of ownership and it was my idea versus being told what to do.
