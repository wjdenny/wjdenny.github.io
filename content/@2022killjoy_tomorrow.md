### Men of the Ashen Marrow
In a global-warming post-apocalyptic future, a god must be summoned every few months to end summer and start winter. The god usually kills some or all of the people who do the ritual, especially if they're not strong enough. 

Interesting [[D&D Campaign Ideas|idea for D&D]].

### A Reasonable Place If You're Careful
### The Name of the Forest
A hitch-hiker meets a helpful woman who turns out to be a bit suicidal. She summons the devil in the forest and swarms of ticks and insects cover the woods suffocating everyone with parasites.

### It Bleeds, It Burrows, It Breaks the Bone
Long ago a woman was decided to be married off to a man she didn't care for. When people were coming for her to force the marriage, she took a bunch of pills and ran off into the woods where she was eaten by wolves.

### The Thirty-Seven Marble Steps
Long ago a woman had a monstrous daughter kept magically hidden beneath her house. Periodically, pets, animals, and small children would disappear from the village. She would feed these to her daughter, opening the trap door to the basement by tapping seven times on the floor. Eventually the woman was apprehended, but no one ever found the daughter in the basement. 

This would make for an interesting [[D&D Campaign Ideas|idea for D&D]].
