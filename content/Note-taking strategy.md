Read and highlight, jot down notes. 
Capture random thoughts even if it doesn't seem entirely related. This leverages the power of diffuse mode of thinking.

Type or copy highlighted notes into a source note. These notes capture metadata about the source material as well as the quotes I want to record.

Re-read those quotes. Mark in bold ideas that seem especially important or useful. Ideas that come up related to the reading should be formed as complete declarative sentences and use that sentence to create a new statement note. That note links to the quote block of the source note.
