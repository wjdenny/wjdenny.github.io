## Rhetorical Précis
[[Jared Henderson]], in his video titled "How to Read (and Understand) Hard Books" (2023) teaches analytical reading skills for dense and challenging texts. He does this through a breakdown of four levels of reading, focusing on the middle two steps including inspectional reading where the reader maps the layout and structure of the text and analytical reading where the reader goes deeper to understand the text more fully. [[Jared Henderson|Henderson's]] purpose is to share critical reading skills from his philosophical training in order to help people become more critical and engaged readers. He adopts an instructional tone for the viewers of his YouTube channel and others interested in the topic of knowledge management and critical reading skills.

## Notes
Levels of reading
- Elementary
	- Sentence-level reading skills
- Inspectional
	- Meta-reading, understanding what the book is about
- Analytical
	- Deeper understanding of the text and its context.
- Synoptical


Steps involve first doing an inspectional read to understand the structure and context of the book. How is it meant to be read? What is it about? What is the genre?

1. Classify the book (inspectional read, i.e., rhetorical précis).
2. X-ray the book (inspectional read, layout and structure, i.e., rhetorical précis).
3. Come to terms with the author. Understand key terms used in the text.
4. Figure out the overall message of the text.
5. Criticize the book fairly
	- Understand what the authors says and why; find out whether it is true. Play devil's advocate.
6. Come to your own conclusion.

Synoptical reading involves reading and comparing multiple books on the same topic.

The inspectional reading level seems to align with the concept of a rhetorical précis that I learned from [[@2017pachecovega_finding]].
