# A Pivotal Praxis

This was a reading from the [[Plurilingual Pedagogies Reading Group]].

> [!summary] Summary
> Silvester (2021) reviews the process and outcomes of a reflective professional development exercise on multilingual students and the role of academic support.

## Notes
> [[Plurilingualism]] relates to the ways in which plurilingual actors work through and across the arbitrary boundaries of their linguistic and communicative competence in order to enact and engage agentively in meaning making and knowledge formation ([[2013 Marshall & Moore|Marshall & Moore, 2013, p. 477]]) (page 111)

[[Plurilingualism is a strategy where speakers of multiple languages use those languages to communicate and learn]]

> As [[Moore and Gajo (2009)]] have shown, these richly varied and overlapping resources provide language users with the cultural capital they need to exert their individual agency in ways that extend beyond what might be possible if they were to draw only on discrete sets of resources from within singular language systems, one at a time. (page 112)

> [[Plurilingualism|Plurilingual repertoires]] are dynamic, uneven, and scaled ([[2019 Piccardo|Piccardo, 2019]]). In other words, they are complex, multilayered collections of resources that language users draw from to navigate shifting communicative contexts. The concept of [[Plurilingualism|plurilingual competence]], rather than being based on multiple, discrete competences in more than one language, challenges the notion of discrete competence. Rather than being additive, [[Plurilingualism|plurilingual competence]] is holistic and transformative ([[2019 Piccardo|Piccardo, 2019]]). (page 112)

[[Language repertoires are not collections of discrete language competencies, but they are combined into a single plurilingual repertoire]]

> The main goal of this chapter is to describe the way our multilingual writing program initiated a shift toward a more dynamic understanding of students' [[Plurilingualism|plurilingualism]] and what this shift meant for our writing instruction. In this chapter I explore a series of critical conversations that occurred during an instructor orientation that helped first-time instructors move from a reductive understanding of language deficits, to a [[Plurilingualism|plurilingual]] understanding of students' vast communicative resources. (page 112)
> 
> These shifts involved rethinking students' prior language knowledge and experiences as resources for the teaching of academic inquiry in English, reexamining the analytical [[Habits of Mind|habits of mind]] that characterize our first-year writing course in relation to [[Plurilingualism|plurilingualism]]. (page 112) ^ee9f08

[[Students come to the classroom with a range of communicative and technological abilities and educational experiences]] 

> I argue for a *[[Pivotal Praxis|pivotal praxis]]*, a theoretically informed orientation to writing instruction that turns on a transformative and holistic understanding of plurilingualism and plurilingual competence. (page 112)

> Despite rather robust collective teaching experiences, many instructors of multilingual composition have had little exposure to plurilingual research or pedagogy. And, while [[2020 Vallejo & Dooly|Vallejo and Dooly (2020)]] note a growing number of empirical studies that contribute to a **==move away from the language differences as "'deficiency' markers .. towards an acknowledgement of the creative processes ... inherent in language learning" (p. 2)==, many of the instructors that I work with are unfamiliar with deficit versus asset-based instruction**. (page 113)

> **==Such an orientation reinforces the view that the instructors' role in the writing classroom is to develop students' language competence by immersion, teaching "English through English,"== as one instructor puts it.** (page 113)

^63f556

> Reinforcing these views are several key contextual factors: a lack of training that focuses specifically on students' [[Plurilingualism|plurilingualism]]; a tacit, default policy of monolingual norming; and a campus-wide policy of remediation. (page 113)

> multilingual  composition at my institution had come to be seen as a support course for students who are struggling to master English. Prior experience teaching "English through English" as well as an institutional context that reinforces remediation have led instructors to unwittingly take up additive notions of language competence that helps to justify a "just add English resources" approach to what is believe to be multilingual students' deficient language competence and under-resourced repertoire. (page 114)

> In addition, instructors would take up for the first time a common reader for multilingual composition, called *Languaging across Texts and Contexts*, that I compiled with a graduate student and multilingual writer who had been participating in the independent studies and course meetings with me prior to the orientation. Our reader brought together both scholarly and more popular writings from across the globe in explorations of language, identity, culture, and writing. Many of the collected pieces had been recommended to us by either instructors or students of multilingual composition. The compilation of the reader and our use of it in both the instructor orientation and in our multilingual composition classes reflected a larger, program-wide investment, inclusive of both instructors and students' recommendations that we diversity our readings and engage in critical inquiry around language. (page 114)

> an awareness of students' plurilingual competence. This awareness was facilitated by a series of critical conversations during the orientation that coalesced in three pivotal moves: 1) recognizing plurilingual resources as assets to the writing process, 2) identifying and pushing back against analytical writing norms, and 3) facilitating the emergence of plurilingual spaces and practices in the writing classroom. (page 115)

> As [[Piccardo (2019)]] makes clear, plurilingualism and plurilingual competence-- as opposed to other constructs-- "posits a single, holistic, fluid, and dynamic repertoire" that one navigates inside depending on context" (p. 193). Citing [[Coste (2014)]], Piccardo sets plurilingual competence against the related terms of multilingualism and translanguaging as language knowledge and skill that is "'not that of a polyglot but rather of ordinary individuals with varied linguistic capital in which partial competences have their place'" (as cited in [[2019 Piccardo|Piccardo, 2019]], p. 193). (page 115)

> Thus, with plurilingual competence "'[w]hat is expected is not maximum proficiency but a range of language skills and receptiveness to cultural diversity'" (as cited in [[2019 Piccardo|Piccardo, 2019]], p. 193). (page 115)

[[Plurilingualism also presupposes an openness to cultural diversity]]

> Lara's essay, "Accents and Discernments," originally published in a forum in *Entropy*, an online creative writing magazine, devoted to publishing literacy narratives that "go against traditional modes of thought, norms, and histories" ("Calls for Submissions", Literacy Narratives section). (page 116)

> Her essay is a coming-of-age narrative in which she describes the struggle between her multilingual upbringings and the literacies she came to know in school. Based on their close readings of these materials, instructors noted different ways in which Lara's struggle to maintain her multilingual identity and plurilingual practice while in school challenged normative understandings of analytical reading and writing in English as a linear, monolingual process of skill development. (page 116)

> In addition, instructors commented on the "messiness" of multilingualism as a jumping-off point for a consideration of how to bridge the arbitrary boundaries around languages that prevent more productive forms of languaging. (page 116)

> Another instructor declared, "Multilingualism is messy!" But they found the promise of multilingualism for learning to write in English in academic contexts to be its messiness. They wrote that the linguistic and cultural flexibility that comes with multilingual experience is beneficial as a foundation for teaching students how to avoid "habits of mind such a generalization, judgment, and habituation" that are counterproductive to analytical reading and writing. (page 116--117)

[[Multicultural and plurilingual experiences can be used to teach students about critical analysis and logical fallacies]]

> What plurilingual resources do *you* bring to the table? (page 117)

> Thinking about ways of bringing students' experiences into conversation with the writings of other multilingual writers, rather than asking students to constantly compare their experiences against a monolingual norm helped teachers expand their practice and develop a plurilingual awareness of students' agency in the classroom. (page 117)

> Mediation is a core concept in plurilingual scholarship. Mediation helps to explain the way students use their language resources to better understand something and co-construct meaning. As North and Piccardo (2017) note, "Mediation involves the use of language in creating the space and conditions for communication and/or learning, in constructing and co-constructing new meaning, and/or adapting the original" (p. 87). So, for example, in small groups where students share common language resources, students may switch, mesh, or draw from a variety of language codes to problem solve, complete tasks, and better communicate instructions to one another. This is a kind of meditated plurilanguaging that help students better engage with course objectives. Plurilanguaging is a strategy that helps with learning, rather than hindering it. (page 117)

> However, during our instructor orientation framed by plurilingual scholarship, our initiation into "habits of mind" took a turn when we considered how plurilanguaging as a mediating and mediated practice brings into focus the ways that analytical reading and writing, defined through certain "habits of mind," actually work to norm analysis, reinforcing a kind of linear thinking process that when not informed by tenets of languaging, may actually inhibit plurilingual creativity and innovation. Marshal and Moore (2013) assert that plurilingual and pluricultural competence is "performed along a 'languaging' continuum where clear borders do not exist between the languages of bilinguals" (p. 477). This ability to exert language resources more fluidly across linguistic barriers allows plurilingual speakers to mediate plurilingual spaces of communication in the classroom, reduce affective blocks and tensions, build bridges, co-construct meaning, pass on information, and act as intermediaries in linguistically diverse contexts. (page 118)

[[Language repertoires are not collections of discrete language competencies, but they are combined into a single plurilingual repertoire]]
[[Plurilinguals have tremendous flexibility in their language usage which allows them to mediate effectively across diverse audiences]]

> A focus on languaging as a habit of mind had the initial effect of helping instructors refocus on students' fluency across language resources and their complex, multilayered communicative repertoires rather than the limits of their analytical writing ability in Standard Written English. (page 118)

> A focus on languaging helped instructors to pivot away from the role of the instructor as deliverer of content to facilitator of plurilingual space shared by both the instructor and students. (page 118)

> One instructor noted, when we shift the focus from counterproductive habits of mind and their "cures" to languaging as "a process that multilingual students already have access to" we are encouraging multilingual students to make the most of their diverse language resources. The instructor continued, "Rather than simply accepting a particular academic discourse and imitating it, students who are languaging are engaging with language-- and with cultural products, with texts-- in a way that questions the discourses they are using." (page 119)

> One instructor's comments, in particular, illustrate how thinking about languaging as a complex practice of bringing multilingual selves, experiences, and resources into dialogue across difference can impact spaces of teaching multilingual composition centered around the idea that first-year students, and especially multilingual first-year students, would find it difficult to think outside of a template structure for academic writing. In our online discussion forum, the instructor wrote that higher-order critical thinking practices like "reading against the grain" and "uncovering assumptions" might be helpful as heuristics for isolated, English-only writing tasks, such as pre-writing in English or the five-paragraph essay, but questioned them as strategies that could be interlaced with students' plurilingual repertoires to bring about fresh, insightful writing. However, a pivotal moment came for this instructor when, after having read about Lara's use of Spanish, Polish, and English in "Accents and Discernments," the instructor began to consider how Lara drew from her multilingual experiences and resources to chart a non-traditional path through college. In posting to peers' comments on the Lara essay in our online discussion forum, the instructor wrote that Lara's languaging functions as an act of "intimacy" for Lara who connects with her family through Spanish and with her neighbors through Polish. The instructor continued that languaging is also a "struggle" for Lara who is judged by her peers and teachers at school for her accent, pronunciations, and use of languages other than English. (page 119--120)

> Using plurilingualism as a resource, both the instructor and the students co-construct the writing classroom as a positive and productive space of plurilingual play and critical inquiry. (page 120)

> As [[Marshall and Moore (2013)]] have argued, plurilingualism works to "dismantle perceptions of arbitrary boundaries within individuals' linguistic repertoires," liberating plurilingual actors to help bridge language differences and challenged language norms and to create and facilitate plurilingual and pluricultural spaces of communication. (page 120)

> Plurilingual constructs such as plurilingualism and plurilingual competence conceptualize students' communicative and linguistic repertoires in terms of "the individual's multiple linguistic experiences and sociocultural interactions across the wide spectrum of her everyday life (home, school, work, leisure, etc.)." As these concentric circles of interaction widen, so too the individual's communicative repertoires expands" ([[2020 Vallejo & Dooly|Vallejo & Dooly, 2020]], pp. 3--4). Indeed, research into plurilingualism in academic settings challenges the notion that academic English "is the sole conduit to success in higher education" ([[2013 Marshall & Moore|Marshall & Moore, 2013]], p. 472). Plurilingual researchers like [[Marshall & Moore (2013)]], [[Piccardo (2019)]], and [[Vallejo & Dooly (2020)]] show how plurilingual actors are highly reflective and knowledgeable, capable of shifting and adapting their linguistic and cultural repertoires to new and changeable contexts. The shifting adaptive nature of plurilingual activity makes it a learning process. Each new opportunity to deploy plurilingual resources is an opportunity to learn from the effects of the deployment. (page 120)

[[Plurilingualism research challenges the insistence on an academic standard English]]

> For instructors of multilingual composition at my institution, being able to imagine plurilingual practices and spaces that support student learning required a pivotal praxis, one that involved a shift from additive notions of language competence that were driving our instructional approaches to a more holistic understanding of multilingual students' communicative repertoires. (page 121)

> A focus on languaging helped the instructors focus on students' fluency across language resources and their complex, multilayered communicative repertoires rather than the limits of their analytical writing ability in Standard Written English. (page 121)

> Plurilingualism "casts the speaker and/or learner as a pivot of language in action, and as a social actor enjoying a significant free space favoring code switching or idiosyncratic utterances" ([[2013 Marshall & Moore|Marshall & Moore, 2013]], p. 496). (page 121)


> Plurilanguaging expands communicative possibilities, and it is something we are all able to do. As [[Piccardo (2019)]] asserts, "We are all, potentially, plurilingual" if we open ourselves up to the transformative possibilities of a more holistic approach to language competence. Becoming more oriented to our students as plurilingual actors has made us no less interested in the teaching and learning of language and literacy. If anything, a plurilingual orientation to language competence has helped our program move beyond the teaching and learning of autonomous literacy skills toward the teaching and learning of deeply contextualized processes of creative, linguistic problem-solving, bridging differences, and challenging imitation through innovation. (page 121)

> Supported and framed by the action-reflection cycle, a pivotal praxis offers the "transformative stance" necessary to align programmatic commitments to plurilingualism to everyday teaching practice ([[2020 Vallejo & Dooly|Vallejo & Dooly, 2020]], p. 11). (page 122)

> At the same time, top-down challenges in the form of a campus-wide policy of placing most new international students in English language improvement classes worked tor reinforce deficit views of multilingual students; language competence, which in turn worked to support instruction based on an additive model. (page 122)

[[Forcing students with different language backgrounds into English language classes reinforces deficit thinking of multilingual students]]

> When do students speak or write in languages other than English? Do students seem to codeswitch back and forth across whole language systems or are there noticeable instances of code-meshing, wherein students draw from multiple sets of integrated language resources across registers and scales of proficiency? Are such instances of language use being taken up intentionally within curricula and teaching practice to facilitate learning? If not, how might such instances of language use be used to support learning? (page 123)
 
> How might curricula be manipulated to encourage students to think reflexively about their language resources in relationship to reading and writing assignments? How might the relationship between English, learning outcomes, and students' varied linguistic resources be reconsidered? (page 123)

> Before our newly framed orientation, many instructors were operating under the assumption that multilingual composition was about helping students to achieve mastery in foundation skills in English for academic writing, with the native speaker as the ultimate comparison. (page 123)

> This shift in our plurilingual awareness helped us to see that one possible option for us could be to facilitate students in developing "a linguistic repertoire in which all linguistic abilities have a place" ([[2001 Council of Europe|Council of Europe, 2001]], p. 5) (page 123)

> Ultimately, the goal of a pivotal praxis is reflective action-taking (page 124)

> Once tacit assumptions have been explored and key plurilingual moments have been identified, the next step toward a pivotal praxis is outlining possibilities for action that pivots away from deficit framings of students' language competence toward more holistic options. (page 124)
