# Preliminary Evidence for the Reliability and Validity of a Foreign Language Anxiety Scale

> [[Elaine K. Horwitz|Horwitz]] validates the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale and confirms that it can be measured accurately and reliably.

## Notes
> The literature on anxiety revealed instruments for several related types of anxiety. Measures of test anxiety (Sarason, 1978), speech anxiety (Paul, 1966), and communication apprehension (McCroskey, 1970) were reviewed to identify relevant items. [page 38]

Useful sources for other forms of anxiety and measurements. 
Test anxiety, speech anxiety, and communication apprehension are considered related but distinct from foreign language anxiety.

> To date, the FLCAS [Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale] has been administered, in a number of separate studies, to approximately 300 students in introductory undergraduate foreign language classes at the University of Texas at Austin and has demonstrated satisfactory reliability with this population. Possible scores on the FLCAS range from 33 to 165. In one sample of 108 students, scores ranged from 45 o 147 (M = 94.5, Mdn = 95.0, SD = 21.4). Internal consistency, as measured by Cronbach's alpha coefficient, was .93, and test-retest reliability over 8 weeks was r = .83, p = .001, n = 78. [1]

What are other uses of this? Is there anything similar for ESL?
What is internal consistency?
What is Cronbach's alpha coefficient?
What is test-retest reliability?

How can these scales be used in the second language? Would it even be ethical to measure anxiety using the exact medium that is suspected to cause anxiety? If I could translate these items into French or Arabic or Swahili, I could do similar tests to confirm its validity.
