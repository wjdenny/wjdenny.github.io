## Rhetorical Précis
%% Review a [description of rhetorical précis from Cuyamaca College](https://www.cuyamaca.edu/student-support/tutoring-center/files/student-resources/rhetorical-precis-description-and-examples.pdf). %%

%%
[Dr. Pacheco-Vega], in [his blog article] titled "[Triaging your reading workload]" ([2019]), argues that [the ways in which we decide when to read an article in more depth can and should vary by individuals and is best learned by experience]. [He] supports this claim by [providing examples of techniques that work for him but others have claimed are not effective as well as vice versa] and finally [encouraging readers to develop their own guidelines for deciding what merits further reading]. [Pachecho-Vega]'s purpose is to [show how to more effectively process reading workloads] in order to [help students and researchers make better decisions about what to read in more depth]. [He] adopts [an informal tone] for the readers of [his blog] and others interested in the topic of [knowledge management].

## Notes
> Some resident students are happy to be freed from labels like ELL (Ortmeier-Hooper, 2008). But the lack of labels can also lead to a lack of accountability (by institutions and writing programs) and a lack of funding for support and services. It can also steer students away from effective academic support. Invisibility can propagate issues of access, academic achievement, and inequity for resident multilingual students. [page 229]

[[It can be difficult to adequately label such a diverse group as linguistic minority students]]

[[It is a challenge to categorize linguistic minority students]]

> Adler-Kassner (2008) reminds us that we need "to be awareof the ideologies associated with the frames currently shaping discussions about education (and writing)" (p. 88) [page 230]

> It was immediately apparent to those of us working directly with multilingual students that there was both a challenge and an opportunity before us. [page 230]

What goals do we have? What opportunities might we have in the future to further them?

> Many ESOL and first-year writing courses are taught largely by adjunct faculty, making it difficult to create professional development opportunities to ensure curricular changes are enacted in the classroom. It is also difficult to track student success once they leave ESOL courses. [page 232]

> ESOL instructors collectively norm and evaluate the writing and listening/speaking abilities of each other's students to assure a fair assessment. [page 232]

> Developmental writing and reading courses also have accelerated courses that can reduce time to degree further for ELLs. [page 232]

> The hiring of a large ESL staff has brought a higher level of expertise to our campus, but it has also led to complacency, since "the ESL teachers will handle it." Institutional silos continue to exist, due in part to how strategic plans outline and allocate resources. Stakeholders working with the different groups of multilingual students-- resident and international-- do not meet or see one another as potential allies. [page 236]
