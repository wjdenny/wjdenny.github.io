> I believe empathy is the foundation of communication and the foundation of relationships. And empathy is something that some of us have to work to build. And so we know that children can build empathy through hearing stories and reading books and thinking about characters. And as we get older, we sometimes forget that. We sometimes forget to think about, what are the other characters thinking? What are the other people around us thinking? How might they be feeling?

> I think a lot of times we jump to conclusions without thinking about challenges that the students are facing. We have to seriously think about how our policies are impacting students and how some of them may actually be negatively impacting students.  

### Jessica Weiss, PhD; Professor, Director of Faculty Development; Department of History; California State University, East Bay [00:00:44] 
> Of course, policies usually listed in the syllabus are one of the first ways that students encounter the discipline. They're one of the first ways the students encounter you as a faculty member. And you want to think about constructing a syllabus that therefore feels inclusive of the student and that conveys an understanding of students' lives.  

### Kristina Ruiz-Mesa, PhD [00:01:16] 
> So the question of excused absences and what counts as an excused absence and what kind of documentation is needed is a very pressing conversation and one that we're having in lots of academic circles. And so what my philosophy is on this is assume goodwill, assume good for your students, and give students the benefit of the doubt. If they say that they have a religious service that they need to attend, believe them. If they say that they don't feel well, believe them. And so I often err on the side of giving students the benefit of the doubt and assuming goodwill.  

### Santiba D. Campbell, PhD [00:01:47] 
> We have to think about how our policies impact student learning. For example, if a student misses class, they may be required to have a doctor's note. But oftentimes students don't come back with a doctor's note. Maybe the student doesn't want you to know why they went to the doctor or the type of doctor they went to. There are other rationales behind why a student may not get that note that goes deeper than being lackadaisical or not just caring.  

### Brokk Toggerson, PhD; Lecturer; College of Natural Sciences, Department of Physics; The University of Massachusetts, Amherst [00:02:13] 
> In my course, I offer a free allotted number of absences that students can use for any purpose. They don't even have to come to me and clear it, they can just use it. This just lets them know that I recognize that they have other constraints beyond school. And I think that that's an important message to send. And on the flip side, it also saves my sanity, because if you've got 600 students coming in to you saying, oh, I can't make this because I need a babysitter, oh, I have a grad school interview that day, oh, I have, you know, I have an EMT shift that during that time. All of those are perfectly valid reasons to be out. And, you know, they don't have to out themselves as to why they were gone.  

### Deirdre, Student, The University of Massachusetts, Amherst [00:03:05] 
> I think that giving students flexibility to make the class work for them and their schedules, especially right now, during such a crazy time, is really important and shows that the professor doesn't just care about you as a number, but also cares about you personally as a student and understands that students are people.

### Beck A. Munsey, PhD, NCC, LPC-S; Department Head & Associate Professor; Department of Counseling; Tarleton State University [00:03:27] 
> I give all my students one free mental health day. So, for the semester. They don't even have to tell me what's going on. I call it a mental health day. You know, I don't care what they're using that free class for, but I think it gives the, you know, it eases the pressure of, oh my gosh, if I miss a class, like this policy is going to hurt me. You know, I still abide by an attendance policy, but it's not always so rigid and strict.  

### Kristina Ruiz-Mesa, PhD [00:03:55] 
> I am very open and say, talk to me. If you have a challenge getting here because of a bus schedule, talk to me. If you can't make it to a class because you have family commitments, talk to me. And so I think that underneath of these policies is communication and creating open lines of communication is most important to inform our policies and to make sure that our policies are best serving the needs of our students.  

### Salvador, Student, California State University, Los Angeles [00:04:19] 
> School doesn't happen in a vacuum. And I think that was really helpful for her to acknowledge that as someone who commutes two and a half hours from home to school, I think it's absolutely imperative that all my professors know that sometimes traffic can get a little bad. And so it's, I might be a few minutes late and there's no part in disinterest of the class, but it's just life. And so I think when she allows that, she's really creating equitable experiences for students.  

### John Paul Horn, PhD, MSW; Assistant Professor; Department of Social Work; California State University, East Bay [00:04:55] 
> I have a very generous late assignment policy. If a student asks me before the paper is due to submit a paper late, I give them up to a week to submit the assignment with no penalty. What I, what I make them do is that I make them send me what they have so far and then if for whatever reason, they can't make the new deadline, I go ahead and grade what they've submitted so that they at least get some points towards their final grade in the course.  

### Jessica Weiss, PhD [00:05:21] 
> One way to preempt the problem of late work can be to provide multiple due dates. Students may be much more likely to live up to a due date that they have self selected, but there's also a default option for when one of the due dates becomes impossible for a student to keep if there is a chance they can use one of the other due dates. And that might solve the problem of late work in its entirety.  

### John Paul Horn, PhD, MSW [00:05:53] 
> I think there's a misconception that students are going to be faced with these immovable deadlines in their careers. And the reality is, is that many times things are delayed and things are late and things are late for reasons that we can't control. So allowing students to turn in papers with a flexible extension deadline teaches them a couple of valuable skills. One, it teaches them that it's okay to ask for help when they need it, but it also teaches them that when you do ask for help, you need to make sure that you've done the things that you need to do in order for you to meet that new deadline.  

[[Holding students to high standards of attendance is based on a false idea of working environments]]

### Lena, Student, California State University, East Bay [00:06:33] 
> Dr. Horn, sort of encourages us to speak up for ourselves in this way, is a really transferable skill in the workplace, because especially this line of work is very demanding, emotionally, I'm learning it requires you to know your limits and to really practice self care. And this was a way of practicing that, I guess, is what I'm getting at. It encourages self care and self advocacy. 

### Kelly A. Hogan, PhD; Associate Dean of Instructional Innovation, QEP Director; STEM Teaching Professor, Department of Biology; College of Arts & Sciences; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [00:07:03] 
> So most of my teaching started with first-year students, first semester in a science course. And I noticed a lot of them really struggled with the first exam and I wanted to give them an opportunity to make up for it. At the same time, I've been learning a lot about this idea of growth mindset and I practice it. I talk about it with my students and I say, you know, mistakes are part of learning. But then where in our syllabi do we often actually live that out? And so one way of doing this is to say I'll only count eight out of ten or I'll drop a grade. And for my students, these science classes feel really high stakes. And so dropping an entire exam grade allows them the opportunity to transition from high school into college science.

### Brianna, Student, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [00:07:54] 
> I'm a little bit anxiety-ridden sometimes when it comes to taking tests. Usually I end up doing fine, but I'm always worried with tests are worth so much of your grade in college. So when I saw that she said that we could take three tests and then our lowest grade would be dropped, my anxiety just went away. I was like, okay, I have a buffer, I have room. If you don't do well on this test, it's okay. Study up, work harder for the next test. This one grade doesn't impact your future in this course.  

### John Paul Horn, PhD, MSW [00:08:24] 
> One of the things that I do to help my students feel confident in the papers that they're going to turn in is that I provide a targeted draft feedback policy. So I allow students to send me portions of their work and give me specific questions that they want to ask me. I look at their work and then I give them targeted feedback based on the questions that they're asking. I think this allows students to feel more confident in the work that they're submitting, and I think it also allows students to get the guidance that they need to be successful in the papers that they're writing for my class.  

### Lizz, Student, California State University, East Bay [00:08:57] 
> English is my second language and it's still is hard for me to write like a perfect paper. So to be able to turn it in earlier and get feedback from there, of course, is really helpful. And we learn from our mistakes, and I really appreciated that also.  

### Jessica Weiss, PhD [00:09:18] 
> The students could start by setting some goals in the course. And then when you're familiar with the students' goals, as you are talking with them about an extension, or dropping a quiz, or a rewrite, you can say, well, you know, rewriting this might really help you with that goal you set of improving your written communication skills. Like that's a way to bring the student in as a partner, give the students some autonomy, but remind them this isn't your policy, but rather their goal.
