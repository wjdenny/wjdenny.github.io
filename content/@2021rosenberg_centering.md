# Centering Students' Language and Literacy Practices

> [!summary] Summary
> Rosenberg and Mangelsdorf write about multilingual students in first-year writing courses.

## Notes

> **The assumption that students either are monolingual, or that they desire the cultural capital gained through monolingual assimilation, points us to the objectives of a statement by the Conference on College Composition and Communication that vigorously opposes standard academic English as the default language of academia** ([[Baker-Bell, et al. (2020)|Baker-Bell, Williams-Farrier, Jackson, Johnson, Kynard, & McMurty, 2020]]). (page 176)

> We recognize that using the linguistic diversity that's already present in our classrooms is not only a matter of tolerance or of creating sections of classes for certain speakers and writers. At the same time, we resist the tendency to make assumptions about our students' identities that determine how they are contained in classes that are designated as mainstream, multilingual, ESOL, or developmental. [[Davila (2012)]] looks at the reality that "particular language features do or do not signal specific identities" (p. 182). **Assumptions about "authorial identity" (p. 182) privilege the standardized variety while denigrating, even ignoring other nonmainstream varieties of English, a practice that can contribute to linguistic racism, as noted in the CCCC statement above.** **==Centering the linguistic and racial diversity of the students and teachers in our classrooms== (as we attempt to achieve through the initiatives we implement) has to do with recognizing the background, identities, and agency they carry as ==sources of knowledge rather than deficits.**== (page 176)

[[Linguistic diversity is present in the classroom whether it is an ESL course or a course full of native English speakers]]

> In "Combating Monolingualism: A Novice Administrator's Challenge," [[Shuck (2006)]] promotes a writing program model that considers language use more broadly rather than by separating mainstream versus multilingual language instruction. (page 176)

> This process, which has been quite successful, demonstrates a model of community engagement that is often taken up by universities seeking to join students' academic interests with the needs of local agencies. In Rhetoric and Writing Studies courses, these projects typically involve writing *for*, *about*, or *with* the partnering organization ([[2000 Deans|Deans, 2000]]). (page 177)

> In the first project, three students worked with Centro de las Mujeres de Esperanza, an organization in El Paso and JuÃ¡rez that helps homeless women, by creating a bilingual newsletter for the agency's donors and sustaining contributors. (page 178)

> Since women at the center didn't necessarily speak English, the newsletter gave them an opportunity to document their stories and share their voices with community members. (page 178)

> In another project, students who volunteered with Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center translated legal documents for people seeking asylum. (page 178)

> Both of these examples show the value of students' knowledge as Spanish-English writers and speakers when they interact in community settings. (page 178)

> A subsequent survey project focused on UTEP and NMSU multilingual students' experiences in their classrooms. Though **plurilingual students generally have high pass rates (70--80%), the researchers discovered that these students were less likely to have access to textbooks and good internet connections compared to their monolingual peers** ([[Brunk-Chavez et al. (2015)|Brunk-Chavez et al., 2015]]; [[Wojahn et al. (2017)|Wojahn et al., 2017]]). Some students also said that they were confused by the Learning Management System (LMS) used by the institution, or they didn't realize that they needed to log on to the LMS at the start o the semester. These survey findings helped instructors understand why some multilingual students might not be reading the textbook or paying attention to their announcements on the LMS. (page 180)

> Monolingual instructors, in particular, came to recognize that when students used a language other than English while working in groups, those who had a stronger English vocabulary acted as language brokers and translated terminology for fellow students whose English was more limited. (page 181)

[[Multilingual students often act as translators and peer mentors for students with less proficiency in English]]

> the bilingual instructor of one of the classes being studied, who said that she always avoided speaking Spanish in the classroom so that her students would have more exposure to English. However, the researchers' observations of her classroom showed that the instructor would, in practice, occasionally use Spanish to explain rhetorical concepts such as discourse community. Her instincts as a teacher-- to use her bilingualism to help her students learn new terminology-- overrode her monolingual language ideology. (page 181)

> Maier found that about one-third of the students who participated in the study refused to translanguage at all because English-speaking and Spanish-speaking family members and teachers had ingrained in them the ideology of language purity. (page 181)

[[Many students have their own beliefs about language purity and may be resistant to invitations to use multiple languages in an activity]]

> The remaining students, however, strategically and resourcefully shifted back and forth from Spanish to English when they wrote. This most frequently occurred when students couldn't think of how to say something in English; they would use Spanish phrasing as a placeholder until they could translate into English by using a translation app or relying on a trusted friend or family member whose English was more proficient. While many instructors might assume that translation apps or relying on friends or family for translations might hinder students' writing development, in actuality this practice fostered their ability to communicate their ideas. (page 181) 

> Within RWS, there is definitely interest in studying the plurilingual speaking and writing practices of our students. (page 182)

> we have looked toward models at other institutions that are specifically designed to ease the transition into American university culture for international and immigrant students, while also acknowledging how these can be fraught (see [[2007 Costino & Hyon|Costino & Hyon, 2007]]; [[2006 Shuck|Shuck, 2006]]). While courses for multilingual writers are significant for helping students to recognize their own cultural and linguistic practices as they shape the acquisition of writing and reading in a new language, we notice an emphasis on preparing students to engage with English as the target language. In the curriculum that we have observed, students may sometimes learn to retain, and, even at times, to mesh language ([[2006 Canagarajah|Canagarajah, 2006]]); however, these classes tend not to be bilingual. Students and instructors assume that the goal is to improve one's writing in English as the privileged language. (page 182)

> Despite news reports and popular media images that portray the Mexico-U.S. border as a contested site, student traffic across the bridges demonstrates that this daily shuttling in both directions is fluid and has  ongoing for many years. (page 183)

> Typically, students coming to UTEP from Mexican high schools are placed either into mainstream FYC classes or ESOL classes once they arrive on campus; however, the ESOL classes that share our course numbering and give students credit for our writing classes do not share our curriculum. Those classes are housed in Languages and Linguistics and are taught by ESOL teachers with different training than those teaching in FYC. Because of a shortage of qualified faculty in the last few years, communication between the two programs has been limited. We share this information about the ESOL program on our campus to demonstrate the need for initiatives that address the real daily conditions that shape our students' relationships to writing across languages. (page 183)

> Many of them already posses a language or dialect that holds more privilege and another that is less valued. The issue is to make such conversations more explicit and engage students in a critical examination of academic discourses and language standards such as SE. (p. 78) (page 183--184)

> As [[2007 Costino & Hyon|Costino and Hyon (2007)]] noticed in their interviews with basic writing students who had the option to choose a mainstream versus multilingual section, it mattered less to their participants whether the course was designated as multilingual or mainstream than that they attended class with peers who shared a similar linguistic and cultural background. (page 185)

> Another effective way to do research at any type of college or university is to collaborate with faculty in other disciplines, such as education or applied linguistics, perhaps to form research teams to help with the intensive labor that most research necessitates. Internal and [[External Research Grants|external grants]] are often more available in these fields compared to rhetoric and writing studies. (page 187)

> For our colleagues who want to consider similar initiatives, we recommend that you educate your faculty, chair, and dean about how a plurilingual approach can benefit your students as researchers, writers, and engagement community members. (page 187)
