## Notes
I still don't like importing notes from reading apps. First, because I don't use them. Second, because I feel like manually reviewing those notes and linking them to projects or topic areas that are relevant helps me stay focused on action. But, folks like [[Eleanor Konik]] undoubtedly produce a lot of work while using that method of dumping notes from their reading app. Am I just slowing myself down? I can experiment with this, but I need to find [[PDF and EPUB reading apps]] that allow me to export highlights and annotations to text.

She avoids links to uncreated pages to reduce the impact of multiple pages of similarly named notes. When she's ready to make the page, she uses aliases to pull it all together. At least that's what I took from it; I think I misunderstood it though, because aliases don't work quite like that. They really only benefit us as an autocomplete suggestion and backlinks.
