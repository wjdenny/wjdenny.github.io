## Notes
> The split brain phenomenon suggests that there can be two separated minds, if you will, inside of a skull. The cooperation is on the paper, not inside the head. It's an astounding example of cross-cueing and management of two mental systems into one unified act. And the idea is maybe that's going on in us all the time, too.

Maybe building a "second brain" or note-taking system like this is sort of an extension of this idea. Only, instead of two halves of a brain, we're managing an infinite number of brains across temporal and attentional dimensions.

> In a lot of the scientific work that's been done on studying emotion in decision making people have really focused on how emotions lead us to make worse decisions maybe even irrational. And I actually don't think that's true. if you have a goal to not want to harm others and to do what's going to be in your self-interest, emotions are actually helping us make better decisions.

Contrary to European concepts of mind-body dualism and rationality, 

It would be interesting to explore non-European medical models and how they integrate mental health; assuming that "Western" divisions between physical and mental health are largely a result of a long tradition of dualism. #topic/culture/dualism
