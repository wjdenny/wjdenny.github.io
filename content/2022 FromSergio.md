# How I Listen AND Take Notes on Podcasts INSIDE Obsidian

> [!summary] Summary
> He uses the [PodNotes](https://github.com/chhoumann/PodNotes) Obsidian plugin, but I don't like this approach. Obsidian does not need to be a podcast organizer and player. I just need to be able to link to specific timestamps in a podcast episode similar to how we can link to specific PDF pages. This is already possible with YouTube videos and possibly PeerTube and others.
