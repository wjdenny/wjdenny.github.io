It seems like [[Eleanor Konik]] and [[Bryan Jenks]] / [[Andy Matuschak]] are in disagreement here, though I don't think their reasons are particularly conflicting. [[Eleanor Konik]] wants it to be as easy as possible. Seems that [[Bryan Jenks]] at least wants it to cost something so that we remember it and also to more easily avoid plagiarism.
