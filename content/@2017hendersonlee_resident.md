## Notes
> "You want to hear me when I write in English; they want to hear a white student." [page 49]

> research on the writing of resident multilingual learners in the secondary context is still somewhat sparse. This is, in part, due to the complex nature of the secondary educational environment, where the writing of these students is often overshadowed by "the more dramatic, threatening, and far-reaching issues learners face and the seriousness of the other language, identity, and agency issues their cases present" (Leki, Cumming, & Silva, 2009, p. 26). [page 49]

> semester-long study of seven resident multilingual high school seniors, this chapter explores four disruptive themes, including forced representations of resident multilingual writers and an unequal trade between language acquisition and subtractive bilingualism, and suggests a postmethod approach to writing programs. [page 49]

> While there have been several calls for the incorporation of social and contextual issues into language acquisition research, Roberts (1998) points out that merely identifying those elements plays "a marginal role in language development" (p. 31). Rather, she encourages the use of a language socialization framework to investigate how learners are introduced to, produce, and understand discourses and how such learning is influenced by assumptions about multilingual learners. According to [[@2003bayley_language|Bayley and Schecter (2003)]], multilingual contexts offer a more accurate picture of language socialization, where the process is lifelong and those being socialized often exhibit agency by choosing among identities offered to them or constructing new identities in situations where they find no desirable choice. Here, I adopt [[@2013norton_identity|Norton's (2000)]] definition of identity, which references "how a person understands his or her relationship to the world, how that relationship is constructed across time and space, and how the person understands possibilities for the future" (p. 5). Because multilingual learners are "socialized by and through language into new domains of knowledge and cultural practice' ([[@2003bayley_language|Bayley & Schecter, 2003]], p. 2) and "it is through language that a person negotiates a sense of self within and across different sites at different points in time" ([[@2013norton_identity|Norton, 2000]], p. 5), a convergence of language socialization and learner identity provided an appropriate framework for this across-curriculum study. [page 50]

> A critical case study methodology was employed to represent the transformative purpose underlying the social constructivism practices of qualitative research. The single-case design (Yin, 2009) allowed for multiple data sources, including in-depth interviews, nonparticipant observations, and written artifacts, to capture the specifics of a commonplace situation (i.e., resident multilingual writers across a secondary curriculum). [page 51]

> Merriam's (2009) checklist of observable elements, including the physical setting, the participants, activities and interactions, conversation, subtle factors, and my behavior as the researcher. ... written texts ... voluntary basis [page 51]

> Hornberger's (2003) continua of biliteracy model, which represents the multiple and complex interrelationships between bilingualism and literacy, was used to help categorize and contextualize the data sources and "make explicit the power relationships which define bi(multi)literacies" (Hornberger & Skilton-Sylvester, 2000, p. 96). [page 51]

> To employ the dual process of immersion and crystallization, I read the collected data sources multiple times and reflected on their relationships to the study's conceptual framework and analytic lens in an attempt to identify and articulate emerging themes (Janesick, 2000). [page 51]

> COB Model (Hornberger & Skilton-Sylvester, 2000, p. 99) [page 52]

What is the COB model? stands for Context of biliteracy

> For many of the participants, writing instruction, practices, and feedback were associated solely with their English and ELL classes. While the division between these two contexts is noteworthy, a greater divide existed between them and other general education classes, mirroring Valdés (1999) two-world distinction for resident multilingual learners in U.S. high schools. [page 52]

> All participants struggled to identify writing instruction in non -English-related general education classes, where the written L2 product was valued over the learner-specific process. This, in turn, resulted in the privileging of power-influenced meaning (i.e., the majority, literary, and decontextualized ends of the content of biliteracy continua), which further disadvantaged resident multilingual students whose writing did not relay similar meaning. [page 52--53]

Maybe this is related to my own difficulty in navigating between those personal-context modes of thought/writing and the more general passive academic voice. I never realized they were so different. So what they're describing happening for biliterate people might also happen for people who grow up without academic literacy in early childhood (i.e., first generation students, working class families, etc.). Or in other words, as pointed out by other scholars, standard academic English is a different literacy from most spoken Englishes. Many people who are successful in college just have an easier time adapting to it both in terms of language and in terms of habits of thought. See: [[Habitus can be hard to confront because it has been naturalized and made invisible]]. What is that process called where we learn something so early and deeply that it's not longer accessible to our everyday thinking?

> note taking was the dominant writing practice . . . This supports the traditionally more powerful side of the development of biliteracy continua where learners are responsible for specific L2 written products regardless of their background. [page 53]

ML studfent support and neurodivergent support converges in note-taking. There's something in an ACUE lecture about this, in the active learning course.

> the power-weighted ends of the biliterate content continua restricted students' access to content by not reflecting their prior knowledge, experiences, and languages. [page 53]

> Tina, for example, was upset that the effort she put into her World History notes benefited her very little when it came to tests because what she viewed as important to write down did not address the teacher's questions. [page 53]

> Because of the complete lack of writing instruction specific to note taking, all participants believed they were expected to already know how to take effective notes in a given subject area and/or note taking was not an equally valuable writing practice across the curriculum. [page 53]

> Writing samples of scientific observations, lab reports, and historical research, for example, were not analyzed as genres with unique discourses, styles, and formats in the classes where students were expected to complete such writing tasks. This absence of intertextuality, or "juxtaposition of texts" (Bloom & Egan-Robertson, 2004, p. 16), represents the power-weighted ends of both the biliterate development and content continua and prevented the fulfillment of the writing-across-the-curriculum component "rhetoric of inquiry," where features of discipline-specific texts are explored (Bazerman et al., 2005). [page 53]

> intertextuality emphasis in English and ELL classes, on the other hand, introduced various writing genres through reading samples. For example, in the English IV class, the writing genre of satire was introduced first as a reading genre, where students read to understand both the text and its writing components. Such incorporation of intertextuality, according to Bazerman et al. (2005), is essential for successful writing-across-the-curriculum programs and curriculums. [page 53]

Use these concepts in my next reading/writing class.

> Realizing the success of his immigrant story, Tim reworked it for a variety of personal experience writing assignments, favoring the traditionally more powerful sides of the context and content of biliteracy. Here, the macro power-weighted end of the biliterate context continua speaks to the societal attitude of the "forever immigrant" while the majority power-weighted end of the biliterate content continua privileges the American dream perspective where immigrant struggles are only associated with individual's home countries. [page 54]

> Andi and Marlene, . . . writing vehicles through which they could represent their true identities and, ultimately, move to the traditionally less powerful sides of the biliterate context and content continua, where their resident multilingual status is valued. In fact, they questioned why this genre was, for the most part, limited to the ELL classroom. [page 54]

> A writing challenge imbalance existed across the curriculum for the participants. Tony, for example, felt challenged by the writing requirements of his English IV class, where he manipulated language to achieve a genre's specific purpose. This was not the case of the writing practices of his other classes, which were limited to summarizing and reporting. [page 54]

> Tim, on the other hand, represented the challenge imbalance by contrasting the personal experience writing most prevalent in the ELL classroom with a Civil War writing assignment in American History. The content specificity of the Civil War writing assignment proved extremely difficult for Tim, who had no prior knowledge of the American war and felt overwhelmed by the related vocabulary. [page 54]

The outcomes of ELA and Comp did not align with writing requirements elsewhere in the college.

> The incorporation of Civil War texts from minority perspectives, for example, might have provided Tim with a contextualized staring point from which to create meaning. [page 55]

That may be true, but how could that work in a course that has students with diverse backgrounds? 

> While Andi believed that his teachers knew about writing in their discipline, he questioned why fell,ow students only felt comfortable conversing about writing with English and ELL teachers. [page 55]

[[The idea of writing across the curriculum spread the responsibility of writing instruction across all departments, instead of just the English department]]

> Moreover, the ELL teacher consistently invited resident multilingual students into conversations about their writing, an act that was significantly less prevalent in the general education classes where access to academic discourse intricacies, as Delpit (1995) notes, is often limited for minority students because they are not familiar with the "codes or rules for participating in power" (p. 24). [page 55] #topic/culture/habitus 

[[Writing, like all arts, must first be learned from imitating appropriate models]]
[[The habitus discussed by Inoue is a style of communication that is adopted by a person to mark them as belonging to a particular group]]
[[Conventional assessment ecologies value habitus more than learning]]
[[Language is learned through a racialized habitus and we make the mistake of assuming all students have adopted a white racial habitus]]
[[Success in conventional classrooms is synonymous with adopting a white racial habitus]]

> Participants like Andi, on the other hand, questioned why grammar was evaluated in classes where grammar was not directly taught. In fact, he complained that he was consistently graded down for grammar on his English IV essays even though grammar was not part of the classroom instruction. [page 55]

I get that that isn't fair. But at the same time, students who lack those grammar skills often end up in more advanced classes for one reason or another, and we can't teach everything. We need to decide whether that grammar is truly necessary, and from the body of scholarship I have been reading, it may not be, to an extent.

[[Grammar acquisition is a gradual process and does not respond to traditional instruction methods]]
[[Feedback on content was found to be more effective than feedback on grammar and sentence structure]]

> Similarly, Tim expressed dislike for such unidirectional feedback and suggested writing feedback be presented as a conversation between student/teacher and student/student, emphasizing process writing over product writing and supporting the traditionally less powerful oral end of the context of biliteracy continua where resident multilingual writers find voice and agency in discussing their texts. [page 56] #topic/teaching/writing/peer-review 

> Tina spent the majority of class time working independently because she was certain neither her teacher nor her classmates would directly call on her. This, she felt, was mostly due to he fact that she was a resident multilingual student. Additionally, she thought her older age contributed to this divide. Mostly on the periphery of classroom conversations (Duff, 2002), Tina felt that her teacher and classmates viewed her as less interested or competent even though she consistently performed well on assignments and tests, and this minimized her investment, interest, and motivation. [page 56] #topic/bias/asset-focused 

Students who do not appear to participate well in class may have their reasons.

> Both Tina and Tim could only recall instances of classroom discourse invites when the topic revolved around their home country, Vietnam. Likewise, Andi remembered only discourse invites in his math and science classes. In many of his other classes, Andi described being purposefully skipped, which resulted in, according to him, many of his teachers and classmates knowing little about him. This would have required them to acknowledge his racial and ethnic differences, which according to Harklau's (2003) "colorblind" representation is discriminatory. [page 56] #topic/bias/asset-focused 

> Marlene, however, thought being ignored was better than always being viewed as needing help, which had been her experience. This representation mirrored Harklau's (2003) "linguistically deficient" representation, where lack of standard English production is viewed as either a linguistic or cognitive deficit.  [page 56] #topic/bias/asset-focused 

^034973

[[Even well-intentioned attempts to support multilingual students are often deficit-based]]
[[Languages other than English should be viewed as assets rather than deficits]]
[[Student success depends on a sense of belonging.]]
[[The dominant narrative of multilingual students is deficit-based]]

> Harklau's (2003) "Ellis Island" representation was most frequently observed in ELL classes where participants recalled writing about their immigrant experience for a number of personal experience assignments. [page 56--57] #topic/bias/asset-focused 

> While not all of these assignments required students to retell their story of coming to America, many required them to make connections to previous experiences in their home countries. For some, like Jack, these were often painful memories, ones he wanted to replace with his current preferred life. [page 57]

I'm definitely guilty of this. I try to give students options, such as "any country you've lived in" but that still centers me and my desire to know more about them. I could instead encourage students to talk/write about something they've learned recently. 

> Regardless of the continually expanding body of literature calling for a bridge between in- and out-of-school literacy practices (Barton & Hamilton, 1998; Gee, 1996; Heath, 1983; Hull & Schultz, 2002), a significant divide existed between home and school literacies for the participants of this study. [page 57]

> wrote outside of school just as much or more than they did in school [page 57]

> Neither Jack nor Marlene, however, recalled an opportunity to bring these writings into the classroom, privileging the power-weighed ends of the content of biliteracy continua and identifying a much needed area of improvement for writing-across-the-curriculum programs and curriculums. For them and other participants, the message here was that in-school writing was more important than out-of-school writing. The representations of these resident multilingual writers across a secondary curriculum resulted in no participants considering themselves to be "good" writers, an obvious consequence for students' language investment (Harklau, 2003); Norton Pierce, 1995). [page 57]

> For some resident multilingual students, this level of attention created a dependency on the ELL classroom, which was often reinforced by general education teachers' willingness to let resident multilingual students go to the ELL classroom to receive help with assignments and tests instead of helping them within the discipline-specific context. In spite of the fact that they allowed students to frequent the ELL classroom, both the Earth Science and the World History teacher were suspicious of the happenings in the ELL classroom. They, for example, wondered how a resident multilingual student who clearly struggled in their class could return from the ELL classroom with "A" work. Further strengthening the divide between ELL and general education classes and teachers is that neither of the teachers addressed their concerns by starting a related dialogue with the student and/or the ELL teacher.  [page 58] #topic/bias/asset-focused 

> The existing disconnect between the *safe house*, or ELL classroom, and the *contact zone*, or general education classrooms (Canagarajah, 1997), is representative of the power elation extremes of the context of biliteracy continua. [page 58]

> The general education teachers, on the other hand, perpetuated the idea of the ELL classroom as a "ghetto" (Valdés, 1998) because it contradicted their familiarity with the power-weighted macro, literate, and monolingual ends of the continua. Here, students are often isolated from general education classes because teachers are uncomfortable with students' resident multilingual status and view them solely as the responsibility of the language specialist. To heal such a divide, Canagarajah (1997) argues that *safe houses* are essential to *contact zones*, supporting a balanced position on the biliterate context continua. [page 58]

How can I learn to facilitate these contentious conversations?

> For most of the participants, the idea of not having a resident multilingual-specific student space in college was worrisome, reiterating Stegemoller's (2009) call for university safe spaces for immigrant students. [page 58]

This is needed because safe spaces are rare. The goal is that all spaces are safe for everyone.

> The minor improvements made in their English writing, for example, did not offset the significant loss of literacy skills within their first languages. In addition to the academic struggles associated with their English language skills, several participants now worried about inadequacies in their primary language. [page 59] #topic/teaching/multilingual #topic/plurilingualism #topic/bias/asset-focused #topic/monolingual-ideology

> Several of the students realized quickly that the preservation of primary language skills, specifically literacy skills, was completely their out-of-school responsibility. [page 59]

"can't teach all languages" -- we can use technology and guided self-study

> A focus shift from solely English acquisition to biliteracy by both teachers and schools would result in a repositioning of resident multilingual students' experiences toward the traditionally less powerful ends of all continua of biliteracy. To accomplish this, however, Fu and Matoush (2006) argue that writing-across-the-curriculum collaboration must first be built on the understanding of writing development as bilingual thinking. When given the writing freedom to move between their primary language and English, Fu, and Matoush (2006) note that resident multilingual students tend to focus less on correct English grammar and more on their content and ideas. [page 59] #topic/teaching/multilingual #topic/plurilingualism #topic/bias/asset-focused 

> By shedding light on the power-weighed positions of seven resident multilingual writers' experiences across a secondary curriculum, this chapter calls for all educators to reorient themselves together toward the needs of these students who deserve "our continual reiminaging and opening up of educational spaces that foster their ogoing development and creative transformation of their transnational--and biliterate--lives and literacies" (Hornberger, 2007, p. 333).
