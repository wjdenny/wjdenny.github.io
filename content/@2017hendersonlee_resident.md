## Rhetorical Précis
%% Review a [description of rhetorical précis from Cuyamaca College](https://www.cuyamaca.edu/student-support/tutoring-center/files/student-resources/rhetorical-precis-description-and-examples.pdf). %%

%%
[Dr. Pacheco-Vega], in [his blog article] titled "[Triaging your reading workload]" ([2019]), argues that [the ways in which we decide when to read an article in more depth can and should vary by individuals and is best learned by experience]. [He] supports this claim by [providing examples of techniques that work for him but others have claimed are not effective as well as vice versa] and finally [encouraging readers to develop their own guidelines for deciding what merits further reading]. [Pachecho-Vega]'s purpose is to [show how to more effectively process reading workloads] in order to [help students and researchers make better decisions about what to read in more depth]. [He] adopts [an informal tone] for the readers of [his blog] and others interested in the topic of [knowledge management].

## Notes
> "You want to hear me when I write in English; they want to hear a white student." [page 49]

> research on the writing of resident multilingual learners in the secondary context is still somewhat sparse. This is, in part, due to the complex nature of the secondary educational environment, where the writing of these students is often overshadowed by "the more dramatic, threatening, and far-reaching issues learners face and the seriousness of the other language, identity, and agency issues their cases present" (Leki, Cumming, & Silva, 2009, p. 26). [page 49]

> semester-long study of seven resident multilingual high school seniors, this chapter explores four disruptive themes, including forced representations of resident multilingual writers and an unequal trade between language acquisition and subtractive bilingualism, and suggests a postmethod approach to writing programs. [page 49]

> While there have been several calls for the incorporation of social and contextual issues into language acquisition research, Roberts (1998) points out that merely identifying those elements plays "a marginal role in language development" (p. 31). Rather, she encourages the use of a language socialization framework to investigate how learners are introduced to, produce, and understand discourses and how such learning is influenced by assumptions about multilingual learners. According to [[@2003bayley_language|Bayley and Schecter (2003)]], multilingual contexts offer a more accurate picture of language socialization, where the process is lifelong and those being socialized often exhibit agency by choosing among identities offered to them or constructing new identities in situations where they find no desirable choice. Here, I adopt [[@2013norton_identity|Norton's (2000)]] definition of identity, which references "how a person understands his or her relationship to the world, how that relationship is constructed across time and space, and how the person understands possibilities for the future" (p. 5). Because multilingual learners are "socialized by and through language into new domains of knowledge and cultural practice' ([[@2003bayley_language|Bayley & Schecter, 2003]], p. 2) and "it is through language that a person negotiates a sense of self within and across different sites at different points in time" ([[@2013norton_identity|Norton, 2000]], p. 5), a convergence of language socialization and learner identity provided an appropriate framework for this across-curriculum study. [page 50]

> A critical case study methodology was employed to represent the transformative purpose underlying the social constructivism practices of qualitative research. The single-case design (Yin, 2009) allowed for multiple data sources, including in-depth interviews, nonparticipant observations, and written artifacts, to capture the specifics of a commonplace situation (i.e., resident multilingual writers across a secondary curriculum). [page 51]

> Merriam's (2009) checklist of observable elements, including the physical setting, the participants, activities and interactions, conversation, subtle factors, and my behavior as the researcher. ... written texts ... voluntary basis [page 51]

> Hornberger's (2003) continua of biliteracy model, which represents the multiple and complex interrelationships between bilingualism and literacy, was used to help categorize and contextualize the data sources and "make explicit the power relationships which define bi(multi)literacies" (Hornberger & Skilton-Sylvester, 2000, p. 96). [page 51]

> To employ the dual process of immersion and crystallization, I read the collected data sources multiple times and reflected on their relationships to the study's conceptual framework and analytic lens in an attempt to identify and articulate emerging themes (Janesick, 2000). [page 51]

> COB Model (Hornberger & Skilton-Sylvester, 2000, p. 99) [page 52]

What is the COB model? stands for Context of biliteracy

> For many of the participants, writing instruction, practices, and feedback were associated solely with their English and ELL classes. While the division between these two contexts is noteworthy, a greater divide existed between them and other general education classes, mirroring Valdés (1999) two-world distinction for resident multilingual learners in U.S. high schools. [page 52]

> All participants struggled to identify writing instruction in non -English-related general education classes, where the written L2 product was valued over the learner-specific process. This, in turn, resulted in the privileging of power-influenced meaning (i.e., the majority, literary, and decontextualized ends of the content of biliteracy continua), which further disadvantaged resident multilingual students whose writing did not relay similar meaning. [page 52--53]

Maybe this is related to my own difficulty in navigating between those personal-context modes of thought/writing and the more general passive academic voice. I never realized they were so different. So what they're describing happening for biliterate people might also happen for people who grow up without academic literacy in early childhood (i.e., first generation students, working class families, etc.). Or in other words, as pointed out by other scholars, standard academic English is a different literacy from most spoken Englishes. Many people who are successful in college just have an easier time adapting to it both in terms of language and in terms of habits of thought. See: [[Habitus can be hard to confront because it has been naturalized and made invisible]]. What is that process called where we learn something so early and deeply that it's not longer accessible to our everyday thinking?

> note taking was the dominant writing practice . . . This supports the traditionally more powerful side of the development of biliteracy continua where learners are responsible for specific L2 written products regardless of their background. [page 53]

ML studfent support and neurodivergent support converges in note-taking. There's something in an ACUE lecture about this, in the active learning course.

> the power-weighted ends of the biliterate content continua restricted students' access to content by not reflecting their prior knowledge, experiences, and languages. [page 53]

> Tina, for example, was upset that the effort she put into her World History notes benefited her very little when it came to tests because what she viewed as important to write down did not address the teacher's questions. [page 53]

> Because of the complete lack of writing instruction specific to note taking, all participants believed they were expected to already know how to take effective notes in a given subject area and/or note taking was not an equally valuable writing practice across the curriculum. [page 53]

> Writing samples of scientific observations, lab reports, and historical research, for example, were not analyzed as genres with unique discourses, styles, and formats in the classes where students were expected to complete such writing tasks. This absence of intertextuality, or "juxtaposition of texts" (Bloom & Egan-Robertson, 2004, p. 16), represents the power-weighted ends of both the biliterate development and content continua and prevented the fulfillment of the writing-across-the-curriculum component "rhetoric of inquiry," where features of discipline-specific texts are explored (Bazerman et al., 2005). [page 53]

> intertextuality emphasis in English and ELL classes, on the other hand, introduced various writing genres through reading samples. For example, in the English IV class, the writing genre of satire was introduced first as a reading genre, where students read to understand both the text and its writing components. Such incorporation of intertextuality, according to Bazerman et al. (2005), is essential for successful writing-across-the-curriculum programs and curriculums. [page 53]

Use these concepts in my next reading/writing class.

> Realizing the success of his immigrant story, Tim reworked it for a variety of personal experience writing assignments, favoring the traditionally more powerful sides of the context and content of biliteracy. Here, the macro power-weighted end of the biliterate context continua speaks to the societal attitude of the "forever immigrant" while the majority power-weighted end of the biliterate content continua privileges the American dream perspective where immigrant struggles are only associated with individual's home countries. [page 54]

> Andi and Marlene, . . . writing vehicles through which they could represent their true identities and, ultimately, move to the traditionally less powerful sides of the biliterate context and content continua, where their resident multilingual status is valued. In fact, they questioned why this genre was, for the most part, limited to the ELL classroom. [page 54]

> A writing challenge imbalance existed across the curriculum for the participants. Tony, for example, felt challenged by the writing requirements of his English IV class, where he manipulated language to achieve a genre's specific purpose. This was not the case of the writing practices of his other classes, which were limited to summarizing and reporting. [page 54]

> Tim, on the other hand, represented the challenge imbalance by contrasting the personal experience writing most prevalent in the ELL classroom with a Civil War writing assignment in American History. The content specificity of the Civil War writing assignment proved extremely difficult for Tim, who had no prior knowledge of the American war and felt overwhelmed by the related vocabulary. [page 54]

The outcomes of ELA and Comp did not align with writing requirements elsewhere in the college.

> The incorporation of Civil War texts from minority perspectives, for example, might have provided Tim with a contextualized staring point from which to create meaning. [page 55]

That may be true, but how could that work in a course that has students with diverse backgrounds? 

> While Andi believed that his teachers knew about writing in their discipline, he questioned why fell,ow students only felt comfortable conversing about writing with English and ELL teachers. [page 55]

[[The idea of writing across the curriculum spread the responsibility of writing instruction across all departments, instead of just the English department]]

> Moreover, the ELL teacher consistently invited resident multilingual students into conversations about their writing, an act that was significantly less prevalent in the general education classes where access to academic discourse intricacies, as Delpit (1995) notes, is often limited for minority students because they are not familiar with the "codes or rules for participating in power" (p. 24). [page 55] #culture/habitus 

[[Writing, like all arts, must first be learned from imitating appropriate models]]
[[The habitus discussed by Inoue is a style of communication that is adopted by a person to mark them as belonging to a particular group]]
[[Conventional assessment ecologies value habitus more than learning]]
[[Language is learned through a racialized habitus and we make the mistake of assuming all students have adopted a white racial habitus]]
[[Success in conventional classrooms is synonymous with adopting a white racial habitus]]

> Participants like Andi, on the other hand, questioned why grammar was evaluated in classes where grammar was not directly taught. In fact, he complained that he was consistently graded down for grammar on his English IV essays even though grammar was not part of the classroom instruction. [page 55]

I get that that isn't fair. But at the same time, students who lack those grammar skills often end up in more advanced classes for one reason or another, and we can't teach everything. We need to decide whether that grammar is truly necessary, and from the body of scholarship I have been reading, it may not be, to an extent.

[[Grammar acquisition is a gradual process and does not respond to traditional instruction methods]]
[[Feedback on content was found to be more effective than feedback on grammar and sentence structure]]
