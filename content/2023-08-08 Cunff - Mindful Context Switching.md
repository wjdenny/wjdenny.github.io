## Notes
> It was inspired by the work of Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths, authors of Algorithms to Live By, who wrote: “You should try to stay on a single task as long as possible without decreasing your responsiveness below a minimum acceptable limit. Decide how responsive you need to be—and then, if you want to get things done, be no more responsive than that.”

> **Define your responsiveness**: If you have high-value customers who expect to hear back from you in less than an hour, that’s how responsive you need to be. If you sell a SaaS product that’s not business-critical, maybe responding to emails once a day is fine. There is no fast-and-hard rule here, but you need to figure out what level of responsiveness will work for your business.

> **Design manageable chunks of work:** Now that you know how responsive you need to be, break down your tasks into manageable chunks that can be done between these response times. Each chunk needs to be realistic, with a beginning and an end. For example, if you need to write an article, one chunk could be to create the outline.
> 
> **Schedule dedicated time**: That’s it for this one. Just put these chunks into your calendar.
>
>**Communicate clearly**: Let everyone you work with know that you won’t be able to respond during these deep work time slots. There are several ways to go about this. If you have a shared calendar, that’s fairly easy. When I was working at Google, I also saw people put it in their email signature or inside an email autoresponder if their response time was longer. Although it may feel weird at first, it’s usually best to overcommunicate.
>
> **Revisit regularly**: Don’t simply duplicate your time slots from one week to another. Reflect on what worked and what didn’t. Were the chunks actually manageable? Was your responsiveness appropriate? You can even proactively ask your teammates for feedback. Play with different configurations until you find the one that works for you.
