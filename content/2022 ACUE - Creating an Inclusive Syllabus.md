I think it's really important to have an inclusive sounding syllabus. It's about word choices and tone. Because really it's like the welcome mat to your classroom.

It's important that a syllabus conveys the same kinds of characteristics that your course conveys. It is the first time your students will meet you before they even, before they meet you in person, right? So this is the invitation, and the invitation to learning, to being part of the community, and that needs to reflect the event.

When we think about the gap in understanding about the role of the syllabus in a course between faculty and students, I think a lot of it has to do with the language and the fact that the syllabus does read like legalese in most cases. And the word I've heard described in the literature is that the syllabus that we've inherited through academia is punitive in tone. And so by revising the language and making the language friendly, making the language comprehensible, and explaining things in a way that is approachable and clear, that becomes a document that's easy to reference and that is useful for students and feels more like a guidebook than a rule book.

Sometimes in the academy, we use so much jargon that we don't realize that it's jargon. So when students come into the classroom, especially if you're dealing with a first-generation student or maybe a non- traditional student that hasn't been in school in a while, they may not even know what a learning objective is. So while great to have those things posted in your syllabus, you should probably walk through them together as a class or create a video that actually explains what the learning objective is.

First, you need to apply psychological principles to everyday life. Maybe asking yourself, I don't know a lot of psychological principles. That's OK. That's the point of this class. So we're gonna go through all of these different principles because there are certain things that are occurring in your life right now that you may not even realize are completely psychological, right? We have theories and different phenomenons to explain them, and that's what we want to learn together on this journey.

So we want to use words that feel warm and welcoming. One thing that I've learned over the years is to use words like "you" and "I," rather than "students shall not." That's not to say we can't have some rules in our syllabus, but there's a, there's a nice way and there's explanatory ways of why you're doing what you're doing. So I often go through my syllabus and 

## I'm looking to say, is there a more student-centered way I can say what I'm trying to say. Brad, Student; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [00:03:05]
The language she used was more welcoming, more than, I guess, demanding. So as a student, I felt more comfortable with her already without even having met her,

My class is about learning how to learn, and I had to rephrase the concept of metacognition because they haven't heard that word yet. I call it Learning How to Learn and Learning How to Improve Your Learning in the syllabus so that they understand what we're talking about. I still use the word metacognition, but I help them see what it's all about. 

## Franky, Student; San Francisco State University [00:03:34]
He uses language that is more inviting and it's more comfortable. And in that way we feel more supported as students that we will succeed in the class.

I put an avatar in my syllabus as a way of I guess helping students see me as less intimidating. A lot of students fear science courses in college. A lot of students fear professors; they're very intimidated. And I thought in this generation where we're all about emojis and memojis, it might be a fun way for them to see who I am and be able to put a little thought bubble next to my face so that they could really see me as the person behind that syllabus. 

## Elizabeth, Student; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [00:04:18]
Her bitmoji on the syllabus was definitely inviting for me. That little extra effort of seeing what she looks like and knowing that she actually cares that, you know, what she looks like is really nice to see. 

## Brianna, Student; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [00:04:31]
I remember the first thing that stuck out to me. I saw her a little bitmoji and I thought it was so cute. I was like, oh my goodness, I love this so much! And then I started reading it and she just lays out all the details of what she expects from us. I enjoyed reading the syllabus because I could clearly understand it. 

## Kelly A. Hogan, PhD [00:04:49]
One of the things that I do is I put icons right on the front page so that as students are giving it a quick scan, they see icons around LBGTQ, plus they see Black Lives Matter. They see that I'm a first- generation college advocate, and so on. I really try to create visuals and this one I thought was a really important visual for creating that inclusive tone. 

## Brianna, Student [00:05:15]
I looked at Dr. Hogan's syllabus and I noticed her different inclusion statements like Black Lives Matter or the LGBT community. I just got a sense of comfort. Obviously, I'm also a part of, I'm a Black student. So one of the things that are very important to me are the Black students on campus at Carolina, especially since it isn't your typical, like, HBCU. It's a predominantly White university. So it's important to know that I was heard and that she is going to be paying attention to these students that sometimes are overlooked.

I have a diversity statement on my syllabus from a few years ago is when I first started putting it on there. And it actually developed from an interaction with a group of students that I'm the faculty advisor for. This group is called oSTEM, which stands for Out in STEM. And the students came to me and they said, we feel like this is missing. There should be a statement about diversity on every professor's syllabus, and I couldn't agree more. So we got to work and we thought about what it would take. I asked them to draft up some language. I brought it to my department, which was an easy starting point. And I said, here, students feel this is missing. Everybody agreed. We wanted to work out the language a bit, which we did as a faculty, and then we adopted it. And everybody should be now putting it on their syllabus. And we've brought it college-wide as a possibility that people can adapt the language for. But now they have a starting point.

I value the perspectives of individuals from all backgrounds reflecting the diversity of our students. I broadly define diversity to include race, gender identity, national origin, ethnicity, religion, social class, age, sexual orientation, political background, and physical and learning ability. I strive to make this classroom an inclusive space for all students. If you see ways I can improve, please let me know. 

## Kelly A. Hogan, PhD [00:07:21]
The diversity statement is important on the syllabus because we can make the assumption about people when we meet them that they are welcoming and inclusive. And so there are lots of ways in our own teaching we need to be more transparent about who we are, that we care about students, but they don't know this about us unless we actually share it and we say it. 

## Brianna, Student [00:07:40]
When I read Dr. Hogan's diversity statement in her syllabus, it meant so much to me because for one, I am a diverse student. I am a woman who is entering a scientific field and I am also a Black woman. So the fact that she cares about diversity and wants for everyone to feel included made me super excited for her class. 

## Kene, Student; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [00:08:02]
I definitely appreciate that she put the statement in there. I think for me, though, I think it's moreso if I see it within the classroom settings. Moreso like about the actions that if they follow the statement, for me. And I definitely think that she exhibited that, like I said, every day,

I think it's crucial to be able to think about the resources that your campus offers from the student point of view. When we're talking about learners who are neuroatypical or learners who come with a disability to our classroom, I prefer to talk about an accessibility statement rather than a statement about accommodations, because accommodation is a way of, in a sense, cordoning off one group of people as different from the other. So my accessibility statement would include reference to our accessibility services support organization for students on campus. It would include my commitment to making material accessible, and it would also make clear that they are invited and welcome to disclose these issues to me, but that it is not necessary that they do so.

Providing students with information about resources and destigmatizing mental health, destigmatizing seeking out other resources is really important. So in our syllabi, we include information about housing and security, about local food pantries, about a Dreamer center and our CAP services, which are student counseling and mental health services. And so the more that we can use our syllabus to take away these stigmas, the better that our students are going to be, the more inclusive they're gonna feel in that space. So I think providing resources, providing the links— And I often provide a statistic before I provide the link. So I talk about the percentage of students that will experience a mental health crisis in college, or I talk about how many students in the CSU have experienced housing insecurity or food insecurity. And again, by putting that out there, we are destigmatizing it and we're opening lines of communication to say, if you experience this, OK, let's work with it. Let's see what we can do so that I can do everything that I can to support you.

A lot of students, I think, like myself, are nontraditional students, right? We have families. We have different responsibilities. And really thinking about those different identities that we hold outside of the classroom and how school engages with our work and family life is so important because it really helps us succeed. It helps, it helped me succeed. And it continuously encourages me to keep on going forward and to reach the goals that I want to reach and do it in a way that that is attainable for me and healthy for me at the same time.
