- Students need choices in order to have agency. [Richard]
- Interlanguage from diverse community members can have an influence on grammar and pronunciation, but people are still able to communicate. [Yasemin]
- Writing skills often end up being stronger than speaking skills as a result. [Yasemin]
- Transportation issues are often a barrier to accessing many support resources. [Yasemin]
- There are also cultural barriers to addressing professors and asking questions. [Yasemin]
- Students often rely on community members for career and academic advising moreso than college staff; community members don't always give good advice. [Yasemin]
- Kibler has a more loose interpretation of Brandt's literacy sponsorship; Brandt uses it mainly to talk about people who encourage or limit literacy activities and learning whereas Kibler extended it to government policies as well. [Tim]
	- *This is why I was confused about the term when I read those chapters; I understood how people could "sponsor" literacy with their social capital, but failed to understand how policies "sponsor"ed literacy in the same way.* Though, on further reflection, it still makes sense; people have social capital, policies have economic and political capital.
