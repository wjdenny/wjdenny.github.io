## Role-model scholars
These are scholars that have done work that aligns well with work I am interested in doing. Part of my process for selecting a Ph. D. program is to identify these scholars and their associated schools to find a program that fits me and my research interests.

Many scholars are well situated in the more specialized fields of TESOL, Second Language Acquisition, Linguistics, English, Rhetoric and Composition, etc. However, the following scholars stand out to me as those who bring those fields into a closer connection to the field of Education.

- [[Kerry A Enright]]
- [[Yasuko Kanno]]

## Associated programs
- [[Stanford University School of Education]]
- [[UC Davis, School of Education]]
- [[Boston University Wheelock College of Education and Human Development]]
- [[University of Toronto Ontario Institute for Studies in Education]]

## Other PhD programs 
- [University of Kentucky, Ph.D. in Higher Education, Specialization in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion](https://education.uky.edu/epe/phd-spec-diversity) seems more focused on DEI generally, but might be a good choice. I'm interested, but I worry about the same thing with Linguistics happening-- too easy to be in competition with people with B.As. Several jobs I found on HigherEdJobs only require a Bachelors even for director positions. These are extremely high salaries for a B.A. too, so I wonder if they only require that because these PHD/SHED-DEI programs are so rare.
	- Get info on faculty in this program
	- curriculum/faculty settled?
	- would linguistic diversity be a good fit?

First choice is UK SHED-DEI
Second choice is UC Davis PhD Education / School Organization and Education Policy deadline is dec 15
