## Notes
Grammar-translation and audio-lingual teaching methods increase affective barriers (p. 109).

The Natural Approach was developed in the 1970s and 80s.  The Natural Approach focuses on supplying students with comprehensible input and allowing the students to naturally progress through stages of language acquisition. The first stage is the Comprehension stage where students are given comprehensible input. Students indicate what or whether they understand, but otherwise are not expected to produce any of the target language. The next stage is the Early Production stage where students are able to respond in words and short phrases. The third phase is Speech Emergence where students are able to produce the target language with increasing fluency. Grammar can still be an interesting topic to study in a Natural Approach classroom, but it is never the focus of the course (p. 109--110). ^929de5

The difference between fear and anxiety is that object of fear is known (p. 110, citing Spielberger and Diaz-Guerrero [1976, p. 6]).

Negative emotional states like fear and anxiety trigger the release of adrenaline (p. 110, citing Levitt [1981, pp. 78--79]).
