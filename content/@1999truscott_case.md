# The Case for "The Case Against Grammar Correction in L2 Writing Classes": A Response to Ferris

- [[John Truscott]] published this article in the [[Journal of Second Language Writing]].

---
> [!summary] Summary
> Truscott defends his earlier statement ([[@1996truscott_case|1996]]) against what he calls weak arguments made by [[@1999ferris_response]].

## Notes
> There is, in my opinion, no situation more undesirable than this for the teaching profession: when one questionable view becomes so dominant that most teachers can scarcely conceive of an alternative, let alone seriously consider it as an option for their own teaching. [[Resources/Articles/1999 Truscott.pdf#page=1|page 111]]

> [[@1999ferris_response|Ferris (1999)]] stats there is "mounting research evidence" for the claim that students benefit from well-done grammatical corrections ([[1999 Ferris.pdf#page=4|p. 4]]) [[Resources/Articles/1999 Truscott.pdf#page=2|page 112]] ... none of this information is provided. [[Resources/Articles/1999 Truscott.pdf#page=3|page 113]]

> I can find only one point at which she says, or even hints, that correction is supported by research evidence. This is the undeveloped claim that [[1990 Fathman & Whalley|Fathman and Whalley (1990)]] and [[1982 Lalande|Lalande (1982)]] provide support (see discussion below). [[Resources/Articles/1999 Truscott.pdf#page=3|page 113]]

> I have searched through three of these sources-- [[1995 Ferris|Ferris (1995)]], [[1998 Ellis|Ellis (1998)]], and [[1993 Bates, Lane, & Lange|Bates et al. (1993)]]--and found nothing that constitutes meaningful evidence. [[Resources/Articles/1999 Truscott.pdf#page=3|page 113]]

- [ ] #task Look into [[1998 Ferris & Hedgcock]] and [[1997 Reid]] to see if they have anything to add to the three that he addressed

> [[1998 Ellis|Ellis (1998)]] cited only one study that bears any resemblance to Ferris's description-- [[1998 Doughty & Varela|Doughty and Varela (1998)]]. This work mixed oral and written correction, with a strong emphasis on the former. So it could not, even in principle, support claims about the effectiveness of correction in writing classes. Moreover, the authors acknowledged that their results were weak for the written side. It was only for students' speaking ability that they made any strong claims of success. For a response to these claims, see [[1999b Truscott|Truscott (1999)]]. [[Resources/Articles/1999 Truscott.pdf#page=3|page 113]]

> As [[@1999ferris_response|Ferris (1999)]] notes, the studies I cited as evidence against correction differed in the types of subjects they used, as well as in their instructional methods and their research designs. Because of these differences, she argues, one cannot make any generalizations from this work. 
> I would argue for the opposite view: That generalization is most reasonable when similar results are obtained under a variety of conditions (as they are in this case) and least reasonable when the conditions are similar for all the studies. When consistent results are obtained under consistent conditions, one can reasonably argue that these specific conditions are responsible for these results. But when similar results appear in widely differing circumstances, no such explanation is available; the phenomenon is a general one. [[Resources/Articles/1999 Truscott.pdf#page=4|page 114]]

But it wasn't just the variety of conditions, but also the variety of subjects (foreign language vs. second language, also possibly the medium of instruction relative to the target language). I think this is still a concern.

> journal writing (the target of the corrections) is a standard part of writing classes, as is correction of the type used by [[1991 Kepner|Kepner (1991)]]. [[Resources/Articles/1999 Truscott.pdf#page=4|page 114--115]]

> Any one study is quite limited in its implications. But when a general pattern emerges from a number of different studies (a pattern of failure, in this case), that pattern must be taken seriously. [[1991 Kepner|Kepner's (1991)]] work is simply one part of the pattern. [[Resources/Articles/1999 Truscott.pdf#page=5|page 115]]

> The problem with pro-correction interpretations of [[1990 Fathman & Whalley|Fathman and Whalley (1990)]] is that the study did not address the question of whether correction makes students better writers. It showed, instead, that the revision process is more successful when teachers participate in it than when students work without assistance. [[Resources/Articles/1999 Truscott.pdf#page=5|page 115]]

> In my discussion of [[1982 Lalande|Lalande (1982)]], I was actually quite conservative. As anyone who reads this study can verify, the popular claim that it found positive effects is simply false. Each of the two groups in the experiment received extensive grammar correction and rewrote their compositions on the basis of that feedback. Over the course of the study, one of these groups showed no significant changes (not even remotely significant) in accuracy and the other had significant declines in accuracy. [[Resources/Articles/1999 Truscott.pdf#page=5|page 115]]

- [ ] #task read [[1982 Lalande|Lalande (1982)]] to see for myself what it concludes

> [[1982 Lalande|Lalande's (1982)]] claim that one group benefited from correction rested on his assertion that, without it, the scores of both groups would have gone down because the grammatical complexity of the students' writing appeared to increase. But there is no reason to accept this assertion, and there is some basis to believe the opposite, that being, without correction, the scores would have gone up as a result of the additional language experience students obtained during the course of the study. Such effects are known to occur ([[1992 Sheppard|Sheppard, 1992]]). The sort of hypothetical considerations Lalande relied on point more toward harmful effects than toward benefits. [[Resources/Articles/1999 Truscott.pdf#page=5|page 115]]

- [ ] #task check out [[1992 Sheppard|Sheppard (1992)]] and add to the list of evidence for and against

> Setting aside the hypothetical claims and looking simply at the known facts-- that neither group improved on [[1982 Lalande|Lalande's (1982)]] measures and that one experienced a decline-- it would be reasonable, again, to treat these results as evidence that correction is either ineffective or harmful. So my conclusion--that they are not evidence *for* correction-- was quite cautious and conservative. [[Resources/Articles/1999 Truscott.pdf#page=5|page 115--116]]

> [[@1999ferris_response|Ferris's (1999)]] second argument for continuing grammar correction is that several inconclusive and uncited studies found that some university instructors who teach content courses are relatively unhappy about the grammar errors of nonnative students. ... the problem with this argument is that it simply assumes that correction will reduce these errors. [[Resources/Articles/1999 Truscott.pdf#page=6|page 116--117]]

> [[@1999ferris_response|Ferris (1999)]] ... offers no challenge to my argument that it has harmful effects on students' attitudes.

[[Truscott claims that error correction has a negative effect on students' attitudes]]

> [[Dana Ferris|Ferris]] does not challenge my argument that correction leads students to shorten and simplify their writing to avoid being corrected, thereby reducing their opportunities to practice writing and to experiment with new forms. In fact, the suggestion that teachers should make students more aware of the importance of avoiding mistakes, if carried out, is likely to exacerbate the problem. [[Resources/Articles/1999 Truscott.pdf#page=7|page 117]]

> [[Dana Ferris|Ferris]] states that effective correction requires teachers to keep track of their students' most serious and most frequent errors (apparently for each individual student) and correct those errors specifically. The time and energy required for this work is clear, especially for those teachers who must deal with large numbers of students. Finally, she leaves unchallenged the claim that students who would benefit from grammar correction must also spend a great amount of time and energy on it and that this devotion will detract from other aspects of their learning. Thus, the part of my argument about the harmful effects of grammar correction is almost entirely unchallenged. In fact, it is stronger after Ferris's discussion than it was before. [[Resources/Articles/1999 Truscott.pdf#page=8|page 118]]

> The power of bias is shown by its appearance in other parts of [[Dana Ferris|Ferris]]'s paper, in which its presence is not acknowledged. One of the specific points of the conclusion, for example, is that issues as important as the use of correction should not be ruled on hastily. The problem with this admonition is that it is directed specifically against decisions *not* to correct grammar errors. A decision to correct is apparently not hasty, nor is a decision to adopt a specific method of correction. The same idea is expressed in Ferris's summary statement: My recommendation is to abandon correction is premature. However, according to this view, recommendations to correct grammar errors, or even to do so in a very specific manner, apparently are not premature. Similarly, my argument that correction should be abandoned is described as a "rush, or stampede, to judgement" ([[1999 Ferris.pdf#page=9|p. 9]]), but this criticism is not applied to arguments in favor of correction, no matter how judgmental they are. [[Resources/Articles/1999 Truscott.pdf#page=10|page 120]]

How do we determine where the burden of proof lies?
[[The burden of proof is on the one making the claim rather than the skeptic]] 

> A more reasonable move is to acknowledge that grammar correction is, in general, a bad idea and then to see if specific cases can be found in which it might not be a totally misguided practice. If and when such cases are identified, correction might become an appropriate, if strictly limited, tool. It should be remembered, though, that the pretense of biennial affects is not, in itself, sufficient justification for correction. It must also be shown that these benefits are substantial enough to justify the problems that accompany the practice or that these problems can be adequately managed. [[Resources/Articles/1999 Truscott.pdf#page=11|page 121]]

> I support the sort of research program [[Dana Ferris|Ferris]] outlines in her conclusion. I may even participate in it. But the logic of such a program needs to be clarified. The goal is not to determine whether and adequate case can be made for abandoning grammar correction-- that has already been done. Its purpose should be to search for those special, hypothetical circumstances under which correction might not be a bad idea. [[Resources/Articles/1999 Truscott.pdf#page=11|page 121]]
