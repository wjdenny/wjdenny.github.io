## Notes
> The findings suggest that the refugee SIFE were in dire need of psychological support, had many responsibilities outside of school, and had high aspirations for the future despite their limited knowledge of the U.S. Educational system. [page 1]

> The UNHCR [United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees] (1950) defines a refugee as "a person who is forced to leave their country due to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion" (p. 16). [page 2] #topic/immigration 

[[Refugees are involuntary migrants that are persecuted for social and political reasons.]]

> Voluntary immigrants often leave their countries in search of better opportunities, while refugees flee without choice. [page 2]

> Due to the influx of refugees into the United States during the last few decades, there had been an increasing number of students with limited or interrupted formal education (SIFE), especially in secondary schools. SIFE are students who speak an addition language(s), have entered a U.S. school after second grade, and function at least 2 years below their peers in reading and mathematics (DeCapua, Smathers, & Tang, 2009). [page 2]

> SIFE are often categorized as a subpopulation of English language learners (ELLs). Due to their unique backgrounds in education, the adolescent students are most at risk with respect to school performance and general well-being within the secondary school population as a whole. [page 2] #topic/education/equity #topic/teaching/tesol/labels

> Beyond individual differences and risks, the schools that SIFE often attend may also make them "at risk" of dropping out of school. A study in Chicago schools have found that low-performing high schools that ELLs often attend also lead to low graduation rates among this population (Gwynne, Lesnick, Hart, & Allensworth, 2009). Majority of ELL SIFE often enroll in urban, overcrowded schools in poor minority areas (Costentino de Cohen, Deterding, & Clewell, 2005; Fry, 2008). In the urban schools, ELL SIFE also attend school with peers who are economically disadvantaged are learning English, and are often taught by un- or under-qualified teachers (Gándara, Rumberger, Maxwell-Jolly, & Callahan, 2003). [page 2--3] #topic/education/equity 

> At a time when ELL SIFE are undergoing unique changes of adolescence physically, emotionally, and sexually, they are also faced with the trauma they may have experienced in the past. In addition, they must adjust to their new country, learn a different language and the culture, and make decisions that would become steeping stones in their careers.

> Immigrants and refugees usually live in areas that offer affordable housing (Orfield, 1998), which are typically located in highly segregated areas where "poverty prevails" (Suarez-Orozco & Suarez-Orozco, 2001, p. 130) and which lack contact with a broad range of Americans. Thus, this physical context can affect the kind of English language that the children learn, the networks that are available to them, and the quality of the local schools (McBrien, 2005; Ngo, 2006; Orfield, 1998). When poverty and racial segregation are combined, outcomes are often unfavorable to student success. [page 3] #topic/immigration #topic/poverty #topic/immigration/enclaves 

> Schuman (1986) highlights that an important measure of refugees' success in adapting to their new environment is the extent to which they are successful learning the language of the host country. While the traumatic and stressful nature of migration may indirectly affect adolescent refugee SIFE's second language learning, other factors, such as prior education, may have a more direct influence. First language education has been found to be correlated with increased proficiency after resettlement in studies of Southeast Asian refugees in the Untied States (Westermeyer & Her, 1996). The implication of these findings is that refugees in urban schools in the United States also struggle with both academic and social difficulties because of their lower levels of formal education. For example, Khmer in Australia (Boua, 1990) and Somalis in New Zealand (Humpage, 1999) who arrived with little formal education and no literacy in their first language had greater difficulties than their immigrant counterparts who had prior formal education. #topic/sla #topic/immigration

> Watkins, Razee, and Richters (2012) also described in their research with Karen refugee women in Australia that the "number one" difficulty that affected their well-being was difficulty with English language proficiency.  Similarly, the limited number of studies in the U.S. context often explored previous educational experiences and how it affects refugee students' adaptation (Tueba, Jacobs, & Kirton, 1990), parental influence on education (Qin, 2006), teachers of refugee students and their challenges (Lee, 2005; Roxas, 2011), and students' identity formation of refugee students (Bal & Arzubiaga, 2014).

> Bourdieu (1991) suggests that students have a better chance at succeeding if they are already familiar with the dominant culture, through which those who possess certain types of capital can build on their experience. [page 4] #topic/academic-capital 

> Schools and other institutions are "important builders (or destroyers) of social capital" (Warner, 1999, p. 384). Curry (2001) also highlights that immigrants who are familiar with the ways and practices of schooling and who have prior formal education do better in schools compared with those who do not. Because SIFE lack the types of schooling capital that is valued in the United States, they are more likely to struggle in adapting to life in schools. [page 4] #topic/academic-capital

> Many students of adolescent immigrants and refugees describe what needs to be in place for students to successfully negotiate their way through high school. It is crucial to respect students' language and culture and create a welcoming, accepting, and caring environment (Casanova, 2006; Cummins, 1986; Freeman & Freeman, 1989; Freeman, Freeman, & Mercuri, 2002; Walsh, 1999). It is essential to provide a safe environment where adolescents are able to explore their racial and ethnic identities. Students also have better and positive learning experiences when they are taught in a developmental rather than a deficit manner and are allowed to build on their existing knowledge (Moll & Ruiz, 2002).

> It also helps to have bilingual counseling in students' native languages (Casanova, 2006; Mace-Matluck, Alexander-Kasparik, & Queen, 1998; Walsh, 1999). [page 4]

> Secondary schools place great demands on students in the content areas, which adolescent refugee SIFE in secondary schools have limited time to meet. By the time they acquire enough English to handle instruction in content areas, they are significantly behind their mainstream peers in content knowledge (Collier, 1987). [page 5]

> Newcomer programs are specifically created programs often within schools to help newly arrived refugees and immigrants acclimate to the school, culture, and academic concepts. [page 5]
> 
> The goal of these [newcomer] programs is to meet the objectives of transitioning students into the culture of the school by providing instruction in content subject areas, to catch them up with their peers so that they can be mainstreamed. [page 5]

> SIFE are placed into this program for up to 2 years of time, but for those whose formal education is severely interrupted, they end up staying in the newcomer program longer than 2 years. [page 5]
