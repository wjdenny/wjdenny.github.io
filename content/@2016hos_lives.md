## Notes
> The findings suggest that the refugee SIFE were in dire need of psychological support, had many responsibilities outside of school, and had high aspirations for the future despite their limited knowledge of the U.S. Educational system. [page 1]

> The UNHCR [United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees] (1950) defines a refugee as "a person who is forced to leave their country due to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion" (p. 16). [page 2] #topic/immigration 

[[Refugees are involuntary migrants that are persecuted for social and political reasons.]]

> Voluntary immigrants often leave their countries in search of better opportunities, while refugees flee without choice. [page 2]

> Due to the influx of refugees into the United States during the last few decades, there had been an increasing number of students with limited or interrupted formal education (SIFE), especially in secondary schools. SIFE are students who speak an addition language(s), have entered a U.S. school after second grade, and function at least 2 years below their peers in reading and mathematics (DeCapua, Smathers, & Tang, 2009). [page 2]

> SIFE are often categorized as a subpopulation of English language learners (ELLs). Due to their unique backgrounds in education, the adolescent students are most at risk with respect to school performance and general well-being within the secondary school population as a whole. [page 2] #topic/education/equity #topic/teaching/tesol/labels

> Beyond individual differences and risks, the schools that SIFE often attend may also make them "at risk" of dropping out of school. A study in Chicago schools have found that low-performing high schools that ELLs often attend also lead to low graduation rates among this population (Gwynne, Lesnick, Hart, & Allensworth, 2009). Majority of ELL SIFE often enroll in urban, overcrowded schools in poor minority areas (Costentino de Cohen, Deterding, & Clewell, 2005; Fry, 2008). In the urban schools, ELL SIFE also attend school with peers who are economically disadvantaged are learning English, and are often taught by un- or under-qualified teachers (Gándara, Rumberger, Maxwell-Jolly, & Callahan, 2003). [page 2--3] #topic/education/equity 

> At a time when ELL SIFE are undergoing unique changes of adolescence physically, emotionally, and sexually, they are also faced with the trauma they may have experienced in the past. In addition, they must adjust to their new country, learn a different language and the culture, and make decisions that would become steeping stones in their careers.

> Immigrants and refugees usually live in areas that offer affordable housing (Orfield, 1998), which are typically located in highly segregated areas where "poverty prevails" (Suarez-Orozco & Suarez-Orozco, 2001, p. 130) and which lack contact with a broad range of Americans. Thus, this physical context can affect the kind of English language that the children learn, the networks that are available to them, and the quality of the local schools (McBrien, 2005; Ngo, 2006; Orfield, 1998). When poverty and racial segregation are combined, outcomes are often unfavorable to student success. [page 3] #topic/immigration #topic/poverty #topic/immigration/enclaves 

> Schuman (1986) highlights that an important measure of refugees' success in adapting to their new environment is the extent to which they are successful learning the language of the host country. While the traumatic and stressful nature of migration may indirectly affect adolescent refugee SIFE's second language learning, other factors, such as prior education, may have a more direct influence. First language education has been found to be correlated with increased proficiency after resettlement in studies of Southeast Asian refugees in the Untied States (Westermeyer & Her, 1996). The implication of these findings is that refugees in urban schools in the United States also struggle with both academic and social difficulties because of their lower levels of formal education. For example, Khmer in Australia (Boua, 1990) and Somalis in New Zealand (Humpage, 1999) who arrived with little formal education and no literacy in their first language had greater difficulties than their immigrant counterparts who had prior formal education. #topic/sla #topic/immigration
