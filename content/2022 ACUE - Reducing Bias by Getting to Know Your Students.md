When I am in a situation where I am the person that is setting the environment that I want for students to feel included and accepted, so I love and embrace everyone from all walks of life, and I want to know more about them, right? And so for me, I think part of it is my desire to want to know more about them is because I want to be as far removed from bias as I possibly can. I want to be an embracer of all peoples, of all walks of life, and so therefore I constantly find myself wanting to get to know my students better.

To help me understand what you're bringing into this class. I would like you all to complete a pre-course writing reflection.  

### [[Kristina Ruiz-Mesa]], PhD [00:00:55] 
I believe a pre-course reflection is a really helpful tool for us as educators to create inclusive classroom spaces.  

### [[Kristina Ruiz-Mesa]], PhD [00:01:03] 
Now, this pre-course writing reflection is not a list of things that you should know or list of prerequisite knowledge that's required for this course. Rather it's, tell me where you're coming from. What do you already know, and what do you hope to learn in this class?  

[[Asking students to write about themselves in the beginning of the semester can help you get to know them better]]

### [[Kristina Ruiz-Mesa]], PhD [00:01:17] 
I also will sometimes ask fun questions. What do you like to watch? What examples of, in the media? What examples in the media excite you right now? And so the more that we can incorporate student interests and the more that we can incorporate what students care about, the more students are going to be engaged in our material.  

## [[Nicole Blalock]], PhD; Assistant Professor, American Indian Studies Program; Core Faculty, Educational Leadership; Policy Studies Doctoral Program; California State University, Northridge [00:01:35] 
> In the pre-course survey, I'll ask questions like students' preferred name, their pronouns, and even questions around their comfort or what they feel like their background knowledge in the topic is to try to get to know them a little bit more and the position that they're coming to class with.  

I can ask students to do a [[Personal Survey]] as the first assignment in the computer lab.

### [[Adannaa O. Alexander]]; Clinical Assistant Professor; Department of Population Health / College of Health Sciences; Sam Houston State University [00:01:54] 
> In the survey, asking them things about, you know, what's your biggest concern? Are there any concerns that I should know about as you get ready for this class so that I'm not looking at students and making some prejudgments, but now I've had a little bit of what, sort of a conversation or a little bit of a touch point with them so I can understand where they're coming from that can hopefully get rid of any biases that I might have from just looking at a student and their behavior. Now, I've kind of understood, okay, this student is working a lot, or has small children, or just maybe some other things that they share with me. Maybe they have a learning disability and they just want that to be known. So I think that can be helpful in getting to know my students and to not make prejudgments on them just by looking at them.  

### [[Viji Sathy]], PhD; Professor of the Practice, Psychology and Neuroscience; UNC College of Arts & Sciences; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [00:02:39] 
> The other thing that it does is it allows them to have a voice before we've even met so they can decide what to share with me. And so an example question might include, tell me, tell me what it feels like to be part of an inclusive classroom. Tell me what it feels like if you're having a hard time thinking about inclusion, tell me what it feels like to be part, to be excluded from a learning experience. So there are certain things that students will share in this that help me learn what kinds of things are going to be helpful to them.

> And again, with 200 students, I can't honor everything that is said, but I can get a snapshot of what is said. And then, of course, when I meet with individual students, I could pull up their responses and I can talk to them about things or I might see something striking and email them and say, "Oh, thank you so much for sharing this with me." And it's, again, another way to just get to know students.  

### Mia, Student, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [00:03:27] 
> I faced a lot of anxiety at the beginning of the course because I was concerned that I just didn't have what it took to do statistics and I think to have the opportunity to express that to Dr. Sathy and say, hey, I'm feeling a little nervous about this, I would appreciate if you could maybe . . . sometimes I may ask you to repeat what you just said or go back a slide, and I hope that's okay. And for her to kind of gauge where I was or where my peers were in the subject, I think helped her to let then plan the material in a way that really met us where we were and for everyone hopefully to be able to grasp the material in a really effective way.  

### [[Rudy Jean-Bart]], MASS [00:04:11] 
> So the first day of class, so the reason why I share or ask five volunteers, and ask them a series of six questions is because I want to set a tone for the entire semester. I want them to recognize the first day of class, this is the place where I belong, I can't wait for the following class session to start. And so the first question is, why are you here? I want to know from the students themselves, like, why are you in college? What got you to this point? The second question is, if you, if this was your last day on earth, unfortunately, who will miss you the most and why? I want for students to think about their legacy. The third question is, what's something that you haven't accomplished that you would like to do before it's all said and done? The fourth question is, tell me about a time that you were confronted with a difficult task or situation and how did you overcome? I want to inspire other students to recognize that that student overcame something traumatic or that student overcame something difficult and that I can, too. Or maybe I can relate to that because many of them have overcome some really harsh circumstances. The fifth question is, who inspires you the most and why? I want to know who gets you going. I want to know about that person, what makes that person special. And then the sixth question is, I tell them I want to make the world a better place. Do you mind helping me with that? I want us to be intentional about being able to make the world a better place. And so those are the six questions that I ask. And then in turn, they get to ask me six questions of their choosing. Getting to know my students and them getting to know me definitely creates a more equitable learning environment because students will succeed more, I believe, when they have a better connection with the professor.  

This inspired me to have a [[First week writing series]] in my reading and writing classes.

### Valerie, Student, Broward College [00:06:08] 
> It matters to me that my professor wants to know me. It matters that they care about my education and my path. That lured me in like that, that first day, because he asked those six questions on the first day in class, and from that I was like, okay, this professor cares. He wants to know. He's curious. He's not just here to spit out information and expect me to put it on a piece of paper, like, he wants to know about me.  

### Jason, Student, Broward College [00:06:37] 
> It shows that the professor actually cares about students and not just, I guess, their reputation about how the university looks at them or whatever, because the fact that he cares about each individual student and how to know them better allows him to teach better.  

### [[Nicole Blalock]], PhD [00:06:59] 
> Another method that I like to use to get to know my students and build community and my courses is open student hours. I find students sometimes find the terminology of office hours intimidating, you know, thinking that they have to have very specific course questions or have to be struggling in a course and able to engage with me outside. And that is why I use the "student hour" terminology.  

### [[John Paul Horn]], PhD, MSW; Assistant Professor; Department of Social Work; California State University, East Bay [00:07:24] 
> One of the ways that I encourage students to schedule office hours with me is that I include a link to a calendar that allows students to schedule time with me. I also encourage students to schedule time with me outside of traditional office hours. Students come from all sorts of different situations and so while a lot of students might be available during the day, a lot of my students have class during the day or they're working or they have family obligations and it might be a little bit more difficult for them to meet me during traditional office hours. So by having after-hours office hours, as well as a weekend office hours, I can make sure that I'm available for the students who might not be able to see me any other way.  

### [[Viji Sathy]], PhD [00:08:06] 
> I created my office hours image because my office hours had evolved over time and I realized that I was using different formats of office hours at different times of the semester, and I felt it would be helpful for students to see that visually. So there are the three categories: we greet, we meet, and we work. And so the "we greet" is just the chance to have a few minutes to get to know each other. Students understand that we may not talk at all about the subject matter. It's really just a chance to to get to know each other a little bit. And then the "we meet" is the more standard. They might have content questions, they might want to talk about anything that might take an extended amount of time. And then the "we work," towards the end of the semester where we have project work, we have exams, where they may have other work and other courses that they'd like to work on with their peers, and so we would sit and work together, of course. And that's a face-to-face environment, but in a digital format, we could just all be on Zoom together, quietly working and if somebody has a question about something, they could pipe in and and ask. So it's just a space where we have permission to interrupt each other as we're working and talk to one another.  

### Mia, Student [00:09:10] 
> So for Dr. Sathy to give a different kind of an array of ways to meet with her for office hours brought a lot of ease to me. I feel like there is this perception of office hours being stuffy and just not personable and uncomfortable. And I think that for us to have the option to have lunch or to sit down and have coffee or to go on a walk or a social distance walk, I think was very helpful in making it feel like she was part of our support system versus kind of this authority figure that we we had to feel anxiety about approaching. 

### [[Beck A. Munsey]], PhD, NCC, LPC-S; Department Head & Associate Professor; Department of Counseling; Tarleton State University [00:09:52] 
> I'm a trans man and I'm very open with my students about that because, again, I want to give them permission to be their authentic selves and a part of the counseling profession. We are authentic and we are authentic with clients. And, you know, there are those professional boundaries which I also teach my students, but we also can share a piece of ourselves and still be professional and still be in this professor/student relationship. With this learning of self and being open with each other and creating this rapport with each other of I see you, you see me, and we're into this together and I'm here for your learning.  

### Paige, Student, Tarleton State University [00:10:29] 
> I will say that he is the only person in our program that I've ever felt authentic enough to even come out as my own. I also identify as lesbian, and so being in his class and him being so authentic and open about his journey and him being a professor and just how far that he's came, I was like, wow, I should have done this a long time ago. Why did I wait? Because I'm so loved and accepted. Because that warmness in the classroom is just, it's incredible.  

### [[Rudy Jean-Bart]], MASS [00:11:02] 
> When we recognize that students are people. I mean, really, truly recognize that students are people with amazing capabilities; that it's not about, therefore becomes not about thinking whether or not they have a diamond within them. It's about recognizing that there's enough digging to be done in order for the diamond to come out. So the question is, are we willing to dig as educators?
