There are three types of interaction in the classroom between resources, learners, and the instructor. These are learner to resource, learner to learner, and instructor to learner. Active learning will engage all three.

Learner to resource would be when students are engaged with the resource directly; whether that is a textbook, video, or their own notes. For example, when they read chapters as homework or review the textbook before an exam. Learner to learner interactions are your standard group work, think-pair-share, and similar activities. An example of instructor to learner would be the ubiquitous lecture.

Promoting and centering learner to learner interactions can develop students' autonomy in the classroom. This would be an application of distributed leadership in the classroom, which also helps take some of the pressure and control out of the instructor's position.
