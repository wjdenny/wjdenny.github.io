## Notes

Stimulant medications are first-line treatments for ADHD that focus on attention, concentration, distractibility, and hyperactivity.
- amphetamine class
	- Adderal, Mydayis; 1:1 racemic amphetamine and dextroamphetamine
	- Vyvanse, Elvanse; lisdexamfetamine
	- Dexedrine; dextroamphetamine
- methylphenidate class
	- Ritalin; methylphenidate
	- Focalin; dexmethylphenidate

Non-stimulate medications
- Kapvay; clonidine; FDA approved in 2009 for adolescents and children
- Intuniv; guanfacine; FDA approved in 2010 for adolescents and children
- Straterra; atomoxatine
- Qelbree; viloxazine

Symptoms of executive dysfunction include trouble with planning, time management, organization, controlling emotions, and set shifting. Though a lot of this also seems like a difference in culture as well; otherwise the majority of my students could be considered to have executive dysfunction. #topic/culture/psychology #topic/neurodivergence

Set shifting is when the brain switches tasks, where it needs to re-focus on a task after being distracted by something else. Everyone might notice some work needed to re-focus, but many with executive dysfunction can be largely unable to set shift. [1:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p5ZeE7gc0I&t=1m30s)

Stimulate medications can exacerbate problems with set shifting.

Marks noted mediocre results with atomoxatine but found viloxazine to be more effective. However, most insurance companies require patients to try and fail atomoxatine before covering viloxazine.

These drugs are norepinephrine reuptake inhibits, increasing the amount of norepinephrine in the pre-frontal cortex. This has a side effect of also increasing dopamine and serotonin in the pre-frontal cortex.
