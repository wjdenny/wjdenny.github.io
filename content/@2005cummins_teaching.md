## Rhetorical PrÃ©cis
%% AI-generated summary
> In "Teaching for Cross-Language Transfer in Dual Language Education: Possibilities and Pitfalls," the author challenges prevailing monolingual instructional assumptions in bilingual education. Rejecting the notion that instruction should exclusively occur in the target language (L2) while disregarding students' first language (L1), the author argues for bilingual instructional strategies that promote cross-language transfer and language awareness. Through examples like dual-language multimedia books and sister-class exchanges, the author demonstrates how these strategies facilitate students' engagement with both L1 and L2, fostering identity expression and collaboration. By critiquing the rigidity of monolingual approaches and advocating for inclusive bilingual practices, the author underscores the importance of leveraging students' linguistic resources to enhance learning outcomes in dual language education.
