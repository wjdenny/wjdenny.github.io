# Anti-Cheating Education Software Braces for AI Chatbots
[[Brad Stone]] wrote this article for [[Bloomberg]].

> [!summary] Summary
> Bloomburg presents a panicked perspective, but there are two points I take issue with. First, The slow pace of innovation in higher education is not the fault of LLMs; it was a weak point that was bound to be exploited eventually. Secondly, ChatGPT is a language model and not a knowledge model and therefore cannot and is not intended to be able to represent knowledge or apply critical lenses to data. The only reason it can "wax on about morality in Shakespeare's final play" is because that has been done a million times already and the model was able to parrot what has been said. Higher education is worried that students using ChatGPT will cause their critical thinking skills to atrophy, but by giving the same old tired assignments, we were already doing that.

## Notes
> Because ChatGPT knows things. It knows the metaphorical significance of Boo Radley in _To Kill a Mocking Bird_. It can opine with relative clarity on the merits of autobiography as a literary form in relation to Richard Wright’s _Black Boy_. It can wax on about morality in Shakespeare’s final play, _The Tempest_.

I think this is not accurate though, because ChatGPT is a language model and not a knowledge model.

> But Chechitelli is also pretty solemn about the challenges schools will face over next few years. “The glacial speed with which change happens in higher education is going to make things hard,” she said. “The conversations need to start on campus today. Students are already well aware of what tools they can use.”
