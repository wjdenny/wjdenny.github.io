## Notes
> Hello, and welcome to Cool People Did Cool Stuff, the podcast that doesn't have a tagline because the title conveys the general purpose well enough on its own. I'm your host, Margaret Kiljoy. And with me today is Shereen Unes, who rules. Hi, Shereen. 
> Thanks. Thanks for thinking I rule. I'm high. I'm good. Hi, how are you?
> All right, good to know you're high. Cool. Okay, moving on. Shereen, you make stuff. What kind of stuff do you make? 
> I make films. I make, even saying art is weird, quote unquote art. Yeah, I just make things. I just made a film, like a little quote, like a video essay thing that I think is not too bad, which is a lot because I hate everything I do.
> Mm-hmm. 
> But yeah, it's, I just make things. I make things. 
> Cool. I appreciate that. Today, we are running without a producer. 
> Oh yeah, that's good thing to mention. 
> Means we can say anything we want. If this goes haywire, that's why. So the way they build a Molotov cocktail is *bleep* and then you *bleep*. 
> Oh, really? 
> Yeah, yeah, no, it's it's different than people might think. And the most important thing is no matter what, never, ever *bleep*. Ian is our audio engineer and on women wrote our theme music. So, Shereen. 
> Margaret.
> Did you know that a lot of people are queer, gay, lesbian, bisexual, trans,
> two-spirit, asexual, intersex, or otherwise don't line up into the nice heterosexual,
> binary sex system that Western society tries to fit everyone into?
> I do know that. I do know that.
> Excellent. Well, that will make this conversation a lot easier.
> What if I was like, no, what do you mean?
> Yeah, you're like one man and one woman.
> Did you know that some people don't like that were like that, like they don't like queer people?
> Yeah, yeah. I think they, I mean, I think everyone is on the queer spectrum,
> even the people that say they hate, they hate it because they're on it.
> Yeah, I think that's fairly true. Yeah.
> I remember the first time a gay friend of mine sat me down was like,
> the reason people say the sexuality is a choice is that for them, it's a choice.
> Oh my God. Well, how have I never thought of that? That is very, very good point.
> Yeah. It's my friend.
> Well, today, we're going to talk about some of the queer people who did something about
> the people who don't like queer people.
> Hell yeah.
> It will eventually get to Molotov cocktails, actually, although this is our first four
> part on the show. It felt timely to talk about this stuff.
> And I couldn't find a simple way to do it. So it's four parts.
> So you're going to get sick of me by the end of this. So buckle up, strap in folks.
> Yeah. Today, we're going to talk about how in June, 1969 in Greenwich Village in New York City,
> someone bit a cop so hard that the cop had to go to the hospital
> and the gay pride movement was born.
> Wow. Wish that was me. That is amazing. I know.
> I want to bite a cop so hard that he just like loses an arm. That is amazing.
> Just zombie a cop.
> Today, we're going to talk about motherfucking Stonewall.
> And by today, I mean in this four part series that will encompass both this week and next week.
> Have you, have you heard much about Stonewall?
> Yeah. I've heard of it. It's a thing that was really important.
> Yeah, it was. It was a very important thing.
> And before we get into it, we're going to use my favorite thing in the world,
> context, a.k.a. backstory or as I call it when I'm talking about my show to my friends,
> side quests. A lot of side quests today, tomorrow, next Monday and next Wednesday.
> It's good to understand the main quest. How else am I going to understand it?
> I know exactly that L adds flavor and I don't know.
> So there's two things that regular listeners are probably tired of hearing me say.
> First, queer people have always been here. Second, the ways in which we define things
> like same sex attraction and having a gender identity or presentation different from your
> sex assigned at birth. Those definitions are socially constructed and they change over time.
> The concepts of homosexuality and heterosexuality, for example,
> in the Western context were invented in the late 19th century.
> And a lot of who we're going to be talking about today would not
> don't map to today's definitions and labels or didn't at the time,
> but are still alive today or were alive recently and then later talked about it.
> So it's like we're going to talk about a lot of, for example, like drag queens,
> many of whom would have identified as gay men, many of whom later identified as trans women.
> We're going to talk about transvestites, which is a word that a lot of people don't use anymore,
> but a lot of people use at the time. I used to use for myself actually before I came out as trans
> because I consider myself a cross dresser for a very long time who just happened to
> have a woman's name and never not wear women's clothes. So things are different and they change.
> That's my background. In our episode about gay resistance to fascism, that was with you,
> I think, wasn't it? I think it was. Yeah, we talked about all the,
> yeah, they ruled. Everyone should go back and listen to that.
> That was a good one. I love being here for the gay shit. That's my shit. Yeah. Fuck yeah.
> So we talked about some of the earliest homophile organizations, as they might have called themselves.
> And we talked about how they were violently repressed under the Nazis and how they didn't,
> they also violently unrepressed against the Nazis when they could.
> We talked about how queer people were put into camps and about how, kind of importantly,
> at the end of the war, when the camps were liberated, both the capitalist block and the
> Soviet block immediately threw the queer prisoners back into prison because being gay was illegal
> and icky and whatever. That's where we left off. We're going to pick up that thread with the Cold
> War, 1940s America, just after World War II. It's going to be a situation that is going to be completely
> unfamiliar to the modern audience. Acceptance of gay, gay lifestyles was flourishing in some places,
> especially in cities. Really? Yeah. Wow. That's news to me, actually. Well, that's actually kind
> of one of the things is that we have this way of talking about gayness as if it was like everything
> was bad and then someone threw a brick at a cop at a place called Stonewall and then everything
> became good. But so acceptance of gay lifestyles was flourishing in cities while American culture,
> more broadly, was moving in a more conservative direction. So everything got set up for conflict.
> So the cops and all that shit are getting more and more conservative and the government's getting
> more and more conservative. But more and more gay bars are opening, more and more people are finding
> each other and more and more people are starting to be like, there's literally nothing wrong with
> who I am except for the fact that the cops hate me. I mean, that sounds like present day.
> It sounds like we're still doing that. So yeah. A number of fucking just one-to-one comparisons
> about what's happening right now. People don't change. It feels like history just repeats itself
> or just stays the same. It doesn't even end and start again. It just keeps
> stagnant. Yeah, totally. Well, you know, little tiny micro loops. Right. So we'll talk about some
> of this conflict. We've all heard of the Red Scare. Really, there were two Red Scare.
> Oh, you mean the podcast? I'm sorry. What if I only thought it was a podcast and not an actual thing?
> I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Wait, what's the podcast?
> It's about communism or is it? I've never listened to it to be fair. I just kind of make fun of it
> a lot. It's a podcast with, it's not really historical. It's just like a, it's just a podcast
> with two gals and that's all I'm going to say about that because I don't want to get too into it.
> All right. Yeah, fair enough. Well, there's, I was going to say there's two and a half Red
> Scares, but there's actually three and a half because one of them is a podcast.
> The first Red Scare was 1917 to 1920 when the US freaked out about the Russian revolution and
> they started deporting the anarchists, which is funny because at the same time the Russian Bolsheviks
> also were freaked out about the anarchists and were shooting them. Wow.
> And so they passed the US, passed this anti-anarchist sedition act of 1918,
> which is part of why I'm very mad that people are calling the genuine six rioters seditionists
> because I literally have the word sedition tattooed on my knuckles.
> Oh my God, you do? Oh my God, she does. I'm looking at her knuckles now in the camera.
> I did not know you had that tattoo. Yeah, I got it a while ago. That's hilarious.
> I was so mad when they started calling. Anyway,
> sedition being the crime of speaking against the government, essentially, which is
> they called January 6 people that I didn't realize they would call it. That's stupid.
> I know. I know. Also, during this Red Scare, there was the Palmer raids, which made use of a,
> did you know that in the United States it is still illegal to be a foreign-born anarchist?
> What about, so you can be a national, a nation-born anarchist?
> Yeah, because of free speech, it's legal to have been born in the US and become an anarchist.
> But there's this law, the Immigration Act of 1903, that specifically is like
> kick out all of the foreign-born anarchists. That is so interesting. I did not know that.
> It's like the line they draw as far as where you're born is like anarchy and president.
> That's what it sounds like. And so it's not enforced anymore, but it'll be interesting
> because it's still on the books. Anyway, they raid and deport a bunch of people and immediately
> people are like, that's an infringement of free speech. Even at the time, people are like,
> I don't think you're allowed to do that. And the government's like, we don't care.
> And we get into it a bit if you want to hear more about this in the birth control episodes
> we did last year with Katie Stoll. Then you get the mini-Red Scare, the half-Red Scare,
> or as I like to call it, or at least I wrote it into the script, the red thrill,
> because the thrill feels like a half-scare, right?
> Oh, yeah, it does. Good call on that.
> Thank you. Thank you. This one was exclusive to New York City. It took place between 1940 and 1942.
> And it's particularly funny that this happened because overall, during these years,
> there was some other stuff happening in the world between 1940.
> That's why I'm surprised. I mean, I guess when you forget the other stuff was happening though,
> when you only know that it was like World War II, I forget that there was other stuff happening
> because it sounds like the whole world was in World War II, because it's fucking cool.
> But it's interesting to hear that this was all happening at the same time.
> I know, and it's particularly interesting because at the time, the USSR was the United States' ally.
> Oh my gosh. And so it was actually a time when even the government was like,
> look, we don't trust communists, but they're not our enemy the Nazis are.
> Well, what a time. Unless you're in New York City.
> It's called the RAP CODER Committee. It's the name of two people.
> Basically, they investigated the public universities to make sure they didn't find any
> pinkos teaching kids and refusing to testify before this committee was grounds for immediate firing.
> And they got one ex-communist to rat out 54 other teachers.
> And you heard the word pinko much? I really like this word.
> No, you said it and I was going to just pretend I knew what you meant,
> but please explain it. Okay. So pinko is this pejorative word for communist.
> And it's an old-timey word. It's our grandparents'
> pejorative word for communist. And it goes back to 1925, I think.
> But it actually being like pink salons was a way to talk shit on communist
> gathering places even before then. And they used pink because it's for two reasons. One,
> it's a softer shade of red. And therefore, these are like the soft communists, the socialists.
> And so that we can understand how this ties into why am I talking about the red scares
> if we're talking about anti-gay shit. Basically, we're calling all the socialists gays.
> They were being like, these effeminate men, these like pink men.
> That's so interesting. What about communism as effeminate?
> Yeah. You know, nothing's effeminate like seizing the means of production.
> Yeah, exactly.
> Or like millions of you charging German tanks. Yeah.
> I mean, like whatever that is, gays did that too. But like, yeah.
> That's interesting. I did not know that.
> Yeah, no. And it's like one of the politicians who liked using the word pinko in the 20s,
> I think he would basically he had these quotes about how like these soft-handed men
> they were working, but they didn't use their hands, you know?
> Just funny because gays, we know how to use our hands. And
> okay, I know you were thinking, you're thinking, can Margaret tie the unabomber into this episode?
> That's exactly what I was thinking, actually. The answer is yes.
> Well, please continue. Yeah. Okay, cool. This one I'm going to be,
> this one is from my memory of being involved in social movements and not
> something that I can directly source. Ted Kaczynski, the unabomber, he goes to jail.
> And for a while, a bunch of environmentalists supported him because he was
> trying to dismantle industrial civilization and all of that stuff.
> But then he wrote this like public letter complaining about pinkos.
> And one publisher was like, oh, we can't use that. That's an anti-gay word.
> And Uncle Ted was like, what? No, it's not about gays. It's an anti-communist word.
> I hate the left. And while I'm at it, I hate gay people too.
> But that's not why I said it. Oh my God. I did not know that even happened.
> Yeah. That's incredible. That's incredible.
> And I'm paraphrasing this, so please don't sue me, Mr. Unabomber.
> That's so funny that like, it's like, no, it's not the hate story that you think it is.
> It's the other hate story. Or is it the same? I don't know.
> Yeah, of course I hate that minority, but that's not what I was saying right now.
> Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Back to the mini red scare.
> I just wanted to talk about pinkos. It's a word we should bring back.
> I mean, maybe other people know about it. I had never really heard it, so you have educated me.
> I'm sure someone else is like me being like, oh, wow.
> New word that we can all use. Yep.
> So it wasn't illegal to be in the Communist Party at this time.
> But the main reason they had this mini red scare,
> it was pretty much to destroy the teachers union, and they fired more than 400 union teachers and
> blacklisted them. Because they were teaching things that they didn't want them to teach?
> Yeah, because they like, possibly had any like, leftist inclinations at all.
> And this of course meant firing the first black faculty member ever hired by a New York City
> public college. His name was Max Jurgen. And to tie everything into what's happening now,
> in this case in Florida, he was teaching a class called Negro History and Culture
> at City College of New York. In the 40s. We don't know what we're hearing right now.
> Like 1940 to 1942. Okay. Yeah.
> So he gets fired basically for teaching black studies.
> Well. And also, it was also an anti-gay panic.
> The judge said about why it was important to fire teachers who teach that being gay is okay,
> that the court will quote, not tolerate academic freedom being used as a cloak to promote the
> popularization in the minds of adolescents of acts forbidden by the penal law.
> Penal law. That was funny. I know what I know what you mean,
> but it's funny just to hear it in that end of that sentence.
> Yeah. What I said earlier, history
> repeats itself in just different clothing.
> Yep. What I came up with while writing this was,
> you know, people say that history doesn't repeat at rhymes,
> but then I actually think it's more like we just keep going back to the chorus.
> You know, the song where the verses change and then the chorus of
> kill all the minorities keeps coming back.
> I love that. That's exactly what it is.
> It's also, it's maybe it's even just like you mess up and you have to go back to the beginning
> and then you keep like messing up with different places.
> So you go back to the beginning.
> Oh my God. Civil rights is groundhog day.
> Yeah, exactly.
> The Bronx bureau president said, quote,
> the colleges would either be godly colleges, American colleges,
> or they would be closed.
> Well, good old America.
> That was Red Scare 1.5.
> Now let's talk about the big one, Red Scare 2.0.
> The second Red Scare is the one that most people know about.
> If someone says the Red Scare, they probably mean the second one.
> This is the one that gets called McCarthyism.
> Right.
> 1947 to 1957.
> Its target was more communist than anarchist this time,
> but both Red Scares went after both.
> This Red Scare, for example, included the anarchist Charlie Chaplin being forced
> into exile away from the US.
> And I really only include this because I like leaving threads to other episodes.
> So if you want to see that, hear more about that,
> the episode of anti-fascism and film with Caitlin Durante.
> Talks about that.
> That is marketing genius.
> Thank you.
> Good job.
> Yeah.
> I just get really excited about this like really intensely dense web of anyway.
> No, it's a great way to just be like, the same way that you're like,
> I had no idea this was happening at the same time.
> It's good to know that like there's all these threads that they're just like,
> oh, this is all intermingled because that's fucking history.
> It's not just like, I don't know.
> Totally.
> Concentrated somewhere.
> And also that our struggles have like always been tied together in all of these ways, right?
> Like the specifically Christophascist, like you must be a godly college thing,
> the firing of the gay teachers, the firing of the like,
> the black studies professor, like it's all been tied together forever.
> Yeah.
> I think that's why like when people are shocked about stuff, sometimes it's a little bit like,
> this has been happening.
> That's how I feel.
> Like it's just like, it's not like, how did we get this way?
> What happened to people?
> It's like, we've always been this way.
> It's just been like bolstered in certain people because it's been so long.
> I don't know if that makes sense.
> I just think it's like, I don't know.
> Yeah.
> Her flavors of the same thing.
> Well, if you want different flavors of the same thing,
> you should try American capitalism,
> where you can go to the store and buy a million types of Oreos, most of which are vegan.
> Yeah.
> Here they are.
> And also you can consume these products and services that support this show.
> Okay, we are back and we are talking about this mass hysteria about communist takeover
> of the US or whatever, the House of Un-American Activities Committee.
> But, and it's famous stuff and I'm sure we'll talk about it more sometime.
> Or if only there was like a podcast that was like about bad stuff instead.
> But you should get on that.
> Yeah, we should make a proposal for that.
> Yeah.
> I heart would love it.
> Yeah, I think it would do really well.
> Nothing like it out there.
> Yeah.
> So, importantly to our story, the Red Scare has this shadow, the lavender scare,
> which targeted gay folks of all stripes.
> And as far as I can tell, it was just as wide reaching and impactful as the Red Scare
> in terms of number of people who were like fired and shit as a result.
> Is that, is this something that people know about or am I just a dummy?
> Like this is not known about.
> Okay, because I've never heard that before.
> It's fascinating.
> Yeah, it doesn't get called this or anything at the time.
> It's just happening.
> It's just the government fucking up gay people's lives.
> In 2004, a guy named David K. Johnson wrote a book on the whole thing called the lavender scare.
> And this kind of cemented the name.
> The name comes from one of the bigots responsible for this repression.
> This one happened to be a Republican.
> I've run across Democrats and Republicans both being very bipartisan.
> This guy's name is Everett Dirksen.
> And he's famous for being the Republican who helped pass the 1964 Civil Rights Act,
> crossing the party lines to vote for the Democrats.
> He hated gay people and he liked to use a somewhat popular anti-gay phrase at the time.
> And he called gay men lavender lads.
> That's kind of sick.
> I know.
> But not that he means it that way.
> I know.
> But that's kind of sick.
> Thanks, dude.
> I know.
> I'm not a gay man, so I can't tell you what slurs to reclaim.
> But imagine the street gang called the lavender lads.
> You would want to go to their parties.
> You would not want to fucking cross them.
> And you wouldn't want to bring your boyfriend because he's going home
> with a lavender lad instead of you.
> That is, I mean, you can't, I feel like you can't get mad at that.
> Like, it's not like he chose anything negative in either of those words.
> It's not like lavender losers.
> It's not like lavender or anything bad.
> It's just like lads.
> Yeah, I know.
> I just love that.
> But despite its sick name, the lavender scare was a bad thing.
> Right, right, right.
> Its main task was to root out and fire all the gay folks in the government and the military.
> And I don't like the government or the military, but that's still fucked up.
> In the first three years of the scare alone, 420 people were fired from government jobs
> on suspicion of homosexuality.
> 1,700 others had their applications denied.
> 4,380 people were kicked out of the military.
> That's so, who's deciding who's gay and who's not?
> Well, this is, that's part of the thing about anti-gay repression.
> And we see this also with what the Nazis did, is that when you decide to go against gay people,
> you can call anyone gay.
> It's really hard to prove that you don't like scissoring.
> It's just your word against theirs.
> And if the person that is calling you gay has more power than you're fucked,
> even if you are or are not gay, damn.
> That's so many people.
> Obviously, it's a lot of people, but it's just crazy that there's always someone deciding
> something for everyone else.
> I don't know if that makes sense.
> It's just like, there are so many huge decisions in all throughout history
> that it's like one or two people, just like some dude deciding on something.
> I always think about that when it comes to like fucking like taxes or something.
> Someone chose this, you know what I mean?
> Like someone chose this and now we're suffering because of it.
> But anyway.
> No, no, I like some of the markers that they used to determine if someone was gay
> and should therefore be fired was being unmarried and talking gay.
> Rude.
> Yeah.
> I mean, kind of, I mean, I relate, but rude.
> I know, I know.
> Also around this time, I think it was the late 40s.
> This didn't end up in the script.
> It almost didn't.
> So now I'm, my memory might be faulty.
> But around this time, the first Kinsey report comes out and these are these studies about
> the percentage of, in this case, it was a study of like several thousand men
> and it was like representative of the US population, which is obviously not true.
> But of these several thousand men in the late 40s,
> only 50% were, had only had heterosexual, sexual experiences.
> Only 50%?
> Yeah.
> So in the 1940s, there were medical studies saying that half of the US population
> is somewhere on the gay spectrum.
> That's incredible.
> Yeah.
> And I think about this a lot because I'm down with the way that we currently have like
> gender as an identity and stuff like that.
> I'm fine with being a trans woman, whatever, you know, but when you didn't have these identities,
> people probably were like maybe doing more fucking of, because there's like less like,
> because now if you are a man, you're gay.
> Yeah, but before you probably weren't gay unless you were mostly having sex with men
> or you were a bottom or all kinds of other shit, you know?
> Right.
> I mean, all throughout history, you see, at least like I always paid attention to
> the close relationships that men had with each other.
> Like even like my father, his like pictures from like his college days,
> like men like loved each other, like just like a different, more like touchy,
> like they never would think like no homo kind of way.
> They just like, that's just how they operated until probably it was labeled as something
> that made them feel shame.
> Yeah, totally.
> And it's such a fucking shame because there's this like massive problem in the US at least
> of like loneliness among males.
> And like, I'm sure a lot of it is that you're not allowed to open up about your emotions
> to anyone except the one woman you're dating or whatever.
> Right.
> Which it puts in.
> Or if that.
> I know.
> And then even so, I feel bad for the one woman you're dating who suddenly you're
> a fucking free therapist and the only person you talk to.
> Anyway, the lavender skin.
> Being a man is hard.
> Sorry.
> No, I mean it's funny because it's like.
> So I'm kidding and also serious, you know what I mean?
> Yeah, yeah.
> And the reason it's hard is patriarchy and homophobia, you know?
> 
> Like we all have the same oppressor and it's patriarchy and homophobia and like
> so the government had an excuse about why I was going after gays.
> It was really that they just like didn't like gays, but it was the idea that closeted homosexuals
> since they were hiding a shameful secret or vulnerable to black male and might
> like give information about government shit to the the russkies.
> Interesting.
> Okay, that's a loophole.
> Have you ever heard one?
> Yeah, yeah.
> One democratic politician put it this way.
> It is generally believed that those who engage in overt acts of perversion lack the emotional
> stability of normal persons or McCarthy himself who basically was like communism and homosexuality
> are both men.
> I'm paraphrasing communism and homosexuality are both mental imbalances and are kind of the same
> thing that was McCarthy's take on it, which is funny because I was thinking this through.
> Okay, it's a real problem if people are have to hide that fact that they're gay
> or be shamed by their society and therefore they're vulnerable to black male.
> What if instead of firing them all, you create a society where people aren't afraid to be
> outed because no one cares?
> Yeah, yeah, I'm just I can't I'm still kind of like processing everything that you said about.
> I don't know.
> I was stuck on the fact that like people were were gay and then they were like in their heads.
> You know what I mean?
> Like the closest relationships.
> But the FBI and cops kept a list of suspect homosexuals and their hangouts.
> The United States Postal Service tracked where gay male got sent and passed that information
> along to the government.
> And even though the whole like main thing was to fire people who worked for the government,
> this led to this massive anti-gay backlash.
> Cities banned cross-dressing, time as a flat circle, bars were raided and shut down,
> professors lost their jobs, all this shit happened.
> By 1953, President Eisenhower signed executive order 10, 0, whatever, 1, 0, 4, 5, 0,
> which included, quote, sexual perversion on a list of bad qualities that were bad for
> government employees.
> Wow.
> And more gay folks were fired from their jobs and some killed themselves.
> Yeah, that's tragic.
> One fired employee, his name was Frank Kameni, and he's today's first protagonist.
> Hell yeah.
> Okay, Frank, let's go.
> Yeah.
> He was born to Jewish parents in New York in 1925, which a lot of people who end up as
> protagonists on this show are Jewish New Yorkers from this era.
> I love that.
> Yeah.
> Love that.
> By 17, he's like mom, dad, I'm an atheist.
> In 1941, he ships off and is part of one of the best things humans have ever done,
> kill the shit out of the Nazis.
> He comes home, he finishes undergrad, he gets his doctorate in astronomy.
> And then in the 50s, I think 1956, he gets arrested for homosexual behavior.
> And this is part of, I think this happens in LA.
> There was this thing that the cops would do where basically anyone who was suspected of
> being gay, they would like, entrap them.
> Like, send someone to be like, yeah, what's up, you want to fuck?
> And the person would be like, maybe.
> And they'd be like, maybe is enough, you're going down, motherfucker.
> Right.
> I think in this case, literally someone came up at a fucking bus stop and grabbed his dick,
> like groped him, and then the cops arrested him for having his dick groped.
> Huh, that's curious.
> Yeah, it's like not my favorite thing that's ever happened.
> Yeah.
> In 1957, he's hired for the Army Map Service.
> But then they're like, because he's an astronomer and he makes maps, I guess,
> and these are related.
> Somehow I'm not smart enough to totally get it.
> And they're like, oh, you got arrested for doing a gay thing, never mind, fuck off.
> And they fire him.
> And they blacklist him from all employment in the federal government.
> This fucking war hero doctorate astronomer who wants to work in the public sector,
> because this is part of it.
> Like, my grandfather works in the public sector.
> He was, you know, worked for the Navy and shit.
> And it is not how to get rich.
> It just isn't.
> The people who do public servant work are fucking doing it because they care about it.
> And I guess he really cared about the stars.
> Until this point, our guy, Frank, he's like this upstanding citizen, right?
> But they kick him out.
> So he sues.
> So he lost.
> So he took him to a higher court.
> He tried to take him to the Supreme Court, and they were like, no, we're good.
> We don't give a shit.
> Damn.
> So he becomes a gay rights radical.
> And he coined the phrase gay is good, which was controversial among gay rights activists at the time.
> Oh, why?
> What?
> Yeah, because this is like one of the kind of complicated things we'll touch on a little bit.
> But I is basically a lot of the gay rights movement before the 40s and 50s.
> And even during the 50s and early 60s, it was very assimilationist.
> And it was and some of it was even like, we are a bit ashamed that this is the way we are.
> And we would like to be better and, you know, kind of like we would like to be straight.
> Or if not, we would like conversion therapy kind of.
> Yeah, or at least like accept that we're deviants and be ashamed and stuff, you know.
> Yeah.
> And he was one of the first like really prominent people being like,
> no, there's literally nothing wrong with the way I am.
> And he was fairly assimilationist and stuff.
> But he fucking did a lot of really important good work.
> And there's kind of this like way of looking back at this history.
> And I will do this a little bit by accident throughout here,
> where I think that the direct action stuff was a lot more effective.
> And so this assimilationist stuff where they just want to be part of mainstream society,
> I'm like less interested in.
> But it's really worth understanding that they did a fuck ton of work.
> And so his name won't come up a ton the rest throughout the episode,
> but basically everything that isn't a riot.
> Frank is there and helping make it happen.
> I love you, Frank.
> Yeah.
> Frank is a good dude.
> Yeah.
> He just wants to talk about stars and learn about stars.
> And they didn't let him do that.
> And so, yeah, that's.
> Like, sorry, you like dick too much to study the stars.
> Yeah, that's, that's not fair.
> It's just like, it's also just like such a very specific expertise, you know what I mean?
> Did they really have a big line of people that wanted to do that?
> Like, yeah, go work for the map service.
> Yeah.
> The lavender scare slowed down in the 60s, but the damage was done.
> In the 1970s, gay people were allowed to become spies for the imperial nightmare
> called the US government again.
> And in 19.
> I love that they're allowed to do stuff that's like.
> Bad.
> Purely.
> Yeah, like purely would benefit them and like put the gay people at risk of like danger.
> Totally.
> It's like, like, no gays in the middle.
> Like, like, yeah, you care about whether your cannon fodder likes.
> Anyway, in 1995, Clinton signed an executive order saying that gay should be allowed at
> the highest level of security clearance.
> And then John Kerry, when he was secretary of the state, put a public apology on the
> State Department website about the lavender scare, basically.
> Within days of Trump's inauguration, the apology came down.
> Oh, my God.
> It was like on January 23rd, people noticed that it was just suddenly missing from the
> website.
> That's crazy.
> I know.
> Someone is like tracking that over the century, just being like up, down, up, edited, down.
> That's crazy.
> Yeah.
> That's crazy.
> The lavender scare is an often forgotten piece of the context for gay rights in the US.
> There's this attitude that's like, yeah, as we talked about, this attitude when it was the
> dark ages when everyone's homophobic and then the gay rights changed all of that.
> But even though it wasn't good for queer folks before the lavender scare, it was a specific
> and intentional destruction of the power of homosexual people done by the federal government
> and local governments, as well as the usual random bigots.
> And I think we need to understand it from that point of view.
> So let's talk about some early gay rights organizations who all had sick fucking names.
> I can't fucking quit.
> I mean, lavender lads is already great.
> That wasn't even their choice.
> I know.
> I know.
> Okay.
> For the most part, the idea that all gays are communists or whatever is bullshit.
> Gays are people.
> People have all kinds of political leanings.
> You know, in our Gays versus Nazis episode, we talked about these names,
> Rom, right, the gay Nazi who got murdered and all that shit.
> But one of the first groups, maybe like the first,
> it's kind of called the first group for gay rights in the US, but whatever.
> Yeah, who knows what the first, yeah.
> Yeah.
> It was formed by a gay communist.
> Hell yeah.
> And the first gay magazine was in Germany.
> We talked about this before, it was made by an anarchist
> because political organizers know how to get shit started.
> And so this guy, his name's Harry Hay.
> And he was a Marxist labor organizer and he was in the communist party.
> And he worked hard in fights against anti-Semitism and anti-Jim Crow,
> which is credit where it's due what the communist party was up to during the red scare.
> That's probably part of why there was a red scare is the fucking communist party.
> Again, I'm not the biggest fan.
> They were fighting hard against racism.
> That's one of the only organized groups of people doing that.
> Harry knew he was gay from a young age.
> He tried being straight for a while.
> He went to the doctor and the doctor was like,
> you know, I've helped a lot of you people get over it.
> You people?
> You just need to marry a lady and by year five, you're just gonna fucking love it.
> So he married this communist lady and it didn't work out.
> Eventually they get separated.
> I don't think on bad terms.
> And he starts a gay rights group and it's called Madachine.
> And it could not have a gayer origin for its name.
> I love, I can't wait to know what that means.
> Harry Hay was into workers education, which is basically popular education.
> He was like, I'm going to go teach the fucking working class stuff.
> But instead of being like yours, like how to balance your checkbook,
> he's like, let's teach you about medieval French costume in theater.
> And there was this.
> Oh, that is so gay.
> I love it.
> That's so gay.
> I love it.
> There was a 16th and 17th century thing.
> It's more early Renaissance as much as it is late medieval,
> but I hate typing the word Renaissance.
> So because I can't spell it.
> So I'm going to call it medieval.
> And it's called mask, the style of dancing with a QUE, not a K.
> And these are elaborate pageants with singing and dancing and costumes and shit.
> And they end up courtly, like for rich people,
> but the rich people are incapable of inventing their own entertainment.
> So they steal ours.
> So there was this mask group called, I can't pronounce French,
> Société Matachine, who gets his name from an Arabic word.
> Matachine comes from an Arabic word that means mask wears,
> which was a Moorish costumed in masked sword dancing.
> It's not the word isn't Matachine.
> I should have written down the Arabic word.
> It's okay.
> I can imagine the origins of it just based on like the sounds in it.
> Matachine.
> Okay.
> Monash.
> I don't know what I'll think of it.
> Okay.
> And so that because there's this Moorish costumed and masked sword dancing called Matachine,
> or called something like Matachine, to quote Jonathan Katz from Gay American History.
> These societies, lifelong secret fraternities of unmarried townsmen who never performed in
> public unmasked, aka probably gay men, were dedicated to going out into the countryside
> and conducting dances and rituals during the Feast of Fools at the Vernal Equinox.
> Sometimes these dance rituals or masks were peasant protests against oppression,
> with the maskers in the people's name receiving the brunt of a given Lord's vicious retaliation.
> So we took the name Matachine because we felt that we 1950 gays were also a masked people
> unknown and anonymous, who might become engaged in morale building and helping others and ourselves
> through struggle to move towards total redress and change.
> So they found 17th and 16th century gay French social revolutionaries
> who were into singing and dancing.
> That's amazing.
> Yeah.
> I think like it's one of those words that like if you know what it means, you're like,
> wow, yes.
> If you don't, you're just like, wow, that's intense sounding.
> I know because it sounds like machine gun or something.
> Yeah.
> It sounds like machine gun.
> If you have machine gun with sounding like a machine gun, like Matachine.
> Matachine.
> Yeah.
> Yeah.
> Sorry, that was again, hi.
> So they start the Matachine society first in Los Angeles.
> And according to Harry Haye, they didn't call themselves gay or homosexual.
> They called themselves temperamental.
> He has a quote, all us temperamental guys we should organize.
> I mean, big save.
> I mean, I love that.
> I know.
> There's this quote from Harry about why he did it, why he started this group that I like.
> I was an older brother, so I had to do a lot of things first.
> My father was a self-made man and he would beat me senseless.
> But he was a Scotsman and stubborn.
> I'm his son and I'm stubborn too.
> I go on being stubborn.
> If you, one of the fellow temperamental guys,
> if you have to wait until I can make it safe, okay, I'll make it safe.
> And if I have to use myself as a battering ram, I'll do that too.
> The best I can.
> I'll tell you a deep dark secret.
> Underneath that facade, I'm a terrified little sissy, just like everyone else.
> But I never let it show.
> Wow, that's like poetry.
> Yeah, yeah.
> That's beautiful.
> That's what we need.
> We need this bravery and we owe it what we have to the
> fucking human battering rams that came before us.
> His partner who helped him start it romantically and in starting this was a
> fashion designer named Rudy Gernreich, who was an Austrian Jewish refugee from the Nazis,
> who later went on to invent the Thong bathing suit,
> the first woman swimsuit without a built-in bra.
> So anytime you're swimming in a swimsuit without a built-in bra,
> you can thank a gay Jewish, probably communist, or at least dating a communist,
> refugee from the Nazis who started the first gay rights organization in the United States.
> Talk about a power couple.
> That is some sick fucking shit.
> I love that.
> And they only dated for a couple years, but he kept funding it for a very long time.
> 
> Yeah, no, totally.
> And his whole thing as a fashion designer was to get rid of the idea that nudity was
> shameful and even inherently sexual, and he designed a lot of unisex clothing.
> Later in life, he got really into making soup.
> He like stopped being a fashion designer and just like made soup recipes.
> What an endearing man.
> And Rudy helped start Madison Society with his boyfriend.
> Gays are the best.
> For the first few years, Madison Society was really fucking neat.
> In LA, gay men were getting routinely entrapped, went out cruising,
> this is the kind of stuff we were talking about.
> Cops would solicit them for sex and then arrest them for lewd behavior.
> Madison fought one of these cases.
> I think the first time anyone fought one of these, but I'm not 100% on that.
> And they won.
> They deadlocked the jury, despite the defendant admitting his homosexuality.
> That's an improvement or like a progress, if you want to call it that.
> Yeah, Madison Society here and then in New York did a lot of work to specifically stop
> the entrapment of gay men by cops.
> Most of its founders were communists anyway.
> So they started in a similar way to the illegal communist party.
> They had like cells, oaths of secrecy, multi-tiered membership,
> like all that like revolutionary organization you hear about in like 20th century shit.
> But there's a problem with that style of organization.
> They were infiltrated like right the fuck away.
> Within six months, they had an infiltrator.
> Every chapter ended up infiltrated
> and they never figured out who any of the infiltrators were.
> Wow.
> So I will say that the 20th century cell structure of resistance is outdated for a reason.
> Wait, so infiltrated by like government?
> Yeah, maybe local cops as well.
> I actually, I'm not actually certain whether those local cops are feds.
> So they're infiltrating to like dismantle it and like
> at least provide information on it.
> But then the Madison Society, actually I wonder if these are related.
> They probably aren't what you just said about the infiltration.
> Pretty quickly got really normie and middle class and assimilationist.
> Early Madison's goals were to basically unify homosexuality
> and see society dramatically transformed as a result.
> Soon enough people were like,
> actually I just wanted to be legal to get my dick wet,
> which is I'm sure how they phrased it.
> And so they kicked out the founders including Harry.
> It might be that driven out is more accurate.
> I've read a couple the ways of relating it.
> It seems like maybe they're always signed after basically they were told like get the fuck out of here.
> And so they went assimilationist.
> I'm not trying to entirely shit on them or anything, but like from
> and apparently one thing I heard was that they would like invite psychologists to come to meetings
> to talk to everyone about how they were like sick and how therapy could help.
> And it was like, and they wanted to, you know,
> they wanted to change the laws to make it more okay, but they also like were like,
> I don't know, whatever.
> I mean, that definitely sounds like an infiltrator tactic in my opinion, right?
> I don't know.
> No, it's possible.
> I don't know.
> Yeah.
> Or it's just like,
> it was so hard to keep up being radical that like they had to water it down to the most simple thing.
> I don't know.
> It's one of those to me.
> Or like, I think a lot of things get started by political radicals,
> both cultural things and political things get started by political radicals
> and then become popular.
> And then as people join it,
> they're there for the like aesthetics or they're there for in this case, the like
> society of men.
> And they're not interested in the thing that started at the seed.
> So the Mattachine Society adopted non-confrontation as a strategy.
> And as far as I'm concerned, non-confrontation is a non-strategy because strategy is how you
> do confrontation.
> Yeah, never works.
> Also, fucking Quaker shit does not fucking work.
> No.
> No.
> And when the Quakers did do good shit, it was when they would like smuggle slaves to freedom,
> not...
> Yeah, they did stuff.
> Yeah.
> Yeah, exactly.
> Confrontational shit that got them killed.
> Yeah.
> They weren't just like pacifists forever.
> They had to actually do something.
> I don't know.
> But and what's interesting is when it got more assimilationist,
> the membership actually dropped.
> People were like just not as interested, I guess.
> And I think this happens a lot.
> People were like, oh, we'll reach more people by being watered down.
> And people are like, no, the spiciness is what fucking drew us here.
> Right.
> It's not cool to be in that group anymore.
> It's like normie.
> Yeah.
> Yeah.
> Harry Hay, he gave an interview in 1998 with The Progressive that I learned a lot from.
> If you're feeling like reading some fucking wise words,
> I think this is where the battering ram quote comes from too.
> Just look up Harry Hay, The Progressive.
> So what he said about all of this assimilationist stuff.
> Quote, assimilation is the way you excuse yourself.
> It absolutely never worked at all.
> You may not think you are noticeable, but they know who you are.
> They know you're a degenerate and they've never forgotten that.
> You won't find out until the push comes to shove.
> And then you'll find out fast because they're respectable in the eyes of God and you aren't.
> And so the journalist in response, I love the way this guy talks.
> I mean, Harry is a fucking poet.
> Yeah.
> That's his words are like, they make me feel things.
> And I don't feel anything.
> And so the journalist is like, no, no, no, like, look, we've made it, you know.
> Which is funny is 1998, we don't even have gay marriage yet.
> Right.
> And he's like, no, we've assimilated whatever they, I'm not quoting in paraphrasing.
> No, we've assimilated whenever they want, they can rewrite the laws and fuck us up.
> Or to quote him, if people become frightened, if something all of a sudden goes wrong in our
> economy and it can, and the preachers start blaming the sin around them on you,
> saying that God's judgment is on you.
> Little by little, they haven't anything to hang onto except that and they'll listen.
> Just as they did in Germany.
> It may take four or five years, but it'll work.
> Well, which is.
> That's haunting to hear spelled out that way.
> Yeah.
> Because that's what's happening.
> Yeah.
> I mean, it's like fucking predicting the future.
> Yeah.
> It's also just so silly that the people, someone like the journalist in 1998 was like,
> we did it because I'm pretty sure like no president even said the word gay or homosexual
> until like Obama or something, right?
> It was just like, I have to look that up.
> I'm pretty positive.
> It was like in recent times, like the, hold on.
> Well, while we're looking up the truth, you can learn the truth from these products and services.
> And we're back.
> Yes.
> I was correct.
> President Obama was the first president to use the word gay in inaugural address to
> reference sexual orientation.
> So.
> Fuck.
> Yeah.
> That was like 10 years after that interview ish.
> Yeah.
> Probably more because he was probably president for a minute, but.
> Well, his inauguration would have been 2009.
> So yeah.
> Oh yeah.
> Okay.
> Yeah.
> Unless he did in a second inauguration.
> But no, I think Harry Hayes words going back to like the actual crux of that stuff before
> the break.
> It's, I don't know, it's really, it's really frightening to see it all spelled out so
> correctly and so scary.
> It's scary to read and hear and then it's happening.
> Yeah.
> It's just like, I don't know, it drives me insane.
> No, no.
> And that, you know, but it's like, okay.
> So the lavender scare sucked, right?
> But it wasn't Nazi death camps.
> And so I think that we need to look at the bad that's coming.
> Couldn't be somewhere on a spectrum.
> Part of where we end up on that spectrum is like how much we all get together and fight.
> You know, like all of us like who are marginalized or people who care about people are marginalized,
> how much we work together to stop it.
> I think we can, we can have some control.
> I don't know.
> I mean, we can at least try.
> I think what really scares me is that the technology is just like at an astronomical
> place that it wasn't at before, like people are doing deep fakes of drag shows where drag queens
> are like, like, I don't know, doing like doing things in front of children that they weren't
> doing in like, I don't know, there's just, there's all these deep fakes that I'm seeing.
> They are actually true.
> One in particular was like this, all these parents and their children are sitting on the floor and
> it was apparently an event with a drag queen reading a story, but instead they've made a
> deep fake with them like dancing kind of like risqué and all that stuff.
> And it looks real.
> And that's what's scary to me.
> It's like, unless you were told like pay more attention to this, this isn't actually happening.
> People are going to like see that and like run with it.
> And that's what's scary to me.
> It's like, the control we have is so fickle.
> That's, that's, I don't know.
> No, I mean, yeah, I,
> Sorry, that was just something.
> No, it's going to be messy in the future is going to be fucking complicated.
> That's what, that just means how that just like emphasizes how important it is to actually like
> fight the good fight and like not give it up because then the fucking weirdos are going to win.
> Hateful meanies.
> Hateful meanies.
> I really like that.
> Because I don't want to, I don't want to call them weirdos.
> I think weirdos are great.
> So I took that back and I said, hateful meanies.
> Well, the temperamental folks of the Mattachine Society, they keep going
> and they do a lot of work building connections with other groups.
> Frank Kameni, the guy, the astronomer guy, he gets involved actually before the split.
> And he starts the DC chapter and he starts pushing to get DC's sodomy laws changed in 1963.
> He starts pushing.
> It takes 30 years.
> The laws against sodomy in the District of Columbia weren't taken out the books until 1993.
> But he worked out it the whole time, right?
> Because I don't want to be like, earlier I was like, oh, they just want to get their dicks wet.
> Like people should be allowed to get their dicks wet.
> That is like one of the base human desires that approximately 50% of the population has.
> And like, anyway, so the founders who left, including Harry,
> they go on to start another group called One Incorporated,
> which is less metal of a name, but is fucking weird.
> One Incorporated.
> Okay, it's kind of vanilla.
> One Comma Incorporated.
> I know, but it's vanilla, but it's like almost like creepy.
> The number one spelled out or the number one?
> Spelled out, yeah, spelled out.
> Okay.
> And One Incorporated let women in.
> Actually, Madison Society was letting women in by this point too, I think.
> And One Incorporated, they found the first LGBT center in the U.S., basically, which is their office.
> It's very similar to what later became LGBT social centers, essentially.
> And in 1953, they published the first pro gay U.S. magazine.
> It was called One, which is a fucking culty name.
> No shade, but that is fucking culty.
> They got the name from the fact that gays refer to each other as one of us.
> And interesting, their magazine got banned from being mailed in 1953,
> same year that it got made, because it was obscene.
> And it had an article about gay men in straight marriages.
> And that was what was a obscene, apparently.
> And they sued and five years later, they won the right to mail their magazine.
> So the entire fucking fifties.
> But the place that One Incorporated got its money.
> This is one of my favorite stories of all of this.
> I'd never heard of this guy.
> There's this trans man philanthropist.
> His name is Reed Erickson.
> Reed Erickson, he inherited his dad's company and he invested in real estate
> and he was a successful businessman and he made a bunch of money, gave a bunch of money away.
> His legal transition, he's a transmasculine person,
> helped set precedent in Louisiana in the fifties about how to get your ID changed, all that shit.
> But he also used the fact that he was rich to be weird,
> which is objectively what you should do when you are rich.
> The only thing you should do when you have money is to do that and be fucking weird.
> And help people, but you know.
> Yeah, yeah.
> Well, he did both and that's what's so cool about him.
> I mean, like I'm sure his businesses did bad things, but
> he was really good to his pet leopard named Henry.
> Repeat, one more time.
> His pet leopard named Henry.
> Henry, yeah.
> Oh my gosh, I mean, I heard you that time for real,
> but I just needed to hear it back one more time.
> Yeah.
> Okay, that's a rich ass thing if I've ever heard of.
> Like that's just, that's something you would only do with an obscene amount of money.
> Yeah.
> It's got a fucking pet leopard named Henry.
> Yeah.
> Who came with him everywhere, including on airplanes?
> No.
> I assume they were private jet.
> I assume it was a private jet.
> That's a well-trained leopard.
> I know.
> Interesting.
> I mean, in my head, like the leopard fights back eventually and like eats him,
> but this is just like the animal revenge story that probably never happened.
> Friends for life.
> What if he was really good?
> Yeah, no, maybe it's like Calvin and Hobbes.
> They were like close.
> Oh.
> I don't know.
> I don't know how he treated.
> Is he a leopard?
> No, he's a tiger.
> Hold on.
> Oh, he's a tiger.
> Okay.
> Sorry.
> 
> You blew my mind for a second.
> Oh my god.
> Yeah, no.
> The other thing he did was finance a ton of LGBT stuff, including one incorporated
> and various gender identity clinics throughout the country.
> I think more or less, if you were a trans person in the 1950s and 60s,
> it was Reed Erickson who was paying the people who were helping take care of you.
> That's pretty cool.
> He, they published, he financed a ton of information and counseling resources for

> They published pamphlets about how to access resources, all that shit.
> And then he died how every, in 1992, he was in his 70s and he was a fugitive from

> And so he was hiding out in Mexico and that's where he died.
> That's, the fact that he used drugs recreationally and that was what made him go into hiding is
> one, depressing.
> Yeah.
> But two, I mean, 70 is a long life.
> 
> It's longer than most.
> No, he did great.
> He did, he did a lot.
> He did a lot.
> If you're going to be a capitalist, be Reed Erickson.
> Yes.
> And if you're going to be,
> Get a leopard and help people.
> Yeah.
> That's all you can do.
