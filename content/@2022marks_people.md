## Notes
> ADHD is a brain disorder where you struggle with attention, concentration, impulsivity,  distractibility or hyperactivity. 

There are multiple types of ADHD. The inattentive type mainly involves trouble with attention, concentration, and impaired motivation.

> Researchers have seen through positron emission tomography which is a brain scan, that people with ADHD have a disruption in the dopamine reward pathway in the brain. 

The brain has four dopamine pathways.

The mesolimbic pathway transports dopamine from the midbrain to the limbic system.
The limbic system is involved in emotional memory. This is where memories of pleasurable activities are recognized and seen as a rewarding experience by associating that memory with dopamine. I imagine it also handles negative associations, too.

The mesocortical pathway transports dopamine from the midbrain to the prefrontal cortex. This is responsible for executive functions like working memory, cognition, and decision making. Stimulants are used to increase dopamine in this pathway specifically.

Maybe the medicine itself can't treat a dopamine transport issue; but using the medicine in concert with developing your reward system is how it should work.

Motivation has four factors: interest, urgency, degree of challenge, and novelty.

Many people with ADHD find that they work well under a time crunch; like when they do something the night before it is due. This is because it increases the urgency associated with the task. But there are other ways to increase urgency that don't require you run so close to the deadline. Using a timer such as in the Pomodoro technique can give a sense of urgency that can translate into motivation. I've found that it works for me when I do it, but sometimes there's not even motivation to set the timer. #topic/neurodivergence 

You can also work or study with someone else. This is also known as *body doubling* and the presence of another person can be stabilizing, motivating, and encouraging. There are also body doubling YouTube videos or "work with me" type videos. This can get at the motivation issue on a number of factors, including urgency (peer pressure) and novelty (new setting). #topic/neurodivergence 

People often increase the novelty of a task by doing it in a different location, like my favorite, a coffee shop or restaurant. I've even used a white noise generator to simulate the sound of a busy coffee shop and that has helped quite a bit. #topic/neurodivergence
