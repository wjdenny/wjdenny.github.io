My reading list got overwhelming very fast. With some advice from [[@2019pachecovega_triaging]], I finally decided to sit down and think about how I wanted to triage readings and projects. Keeping it simple, I narrowed it down to three levels.

When a reading or project is complete, the triage tag can be removed.

# \#triage/curiosity
Something about the reading or project interested me, but it does not align with my [[12 Most Interesting Questions|most interesting questions]] or [[current priorities]]. If similar topics keep popping up, I may need to either get better at ignoring them or revise those questions and priorities. Readings or projects triaged to this level may never get done, but will be saved in case those questions or priorities change. If I do read a source with this triage level, it will generally be only for a tangential citation; getting the general ideas for a [[Rhetorical Précis]].

```query
tag:#triage/curiosity
```
# \#triage/important
The reading or project aligns with my [[12 Most Interesting Questions|most interesting questions]] but is not a [[current priorities|current priority]]. Readings or projects triaged to this level may get done during down times after priorities have been met. If I read a source with this triage level, it will generally be for an important citation that requires a basic grasp of the content. This will involve a [[Rhetorical Précis]], quotations, and synthesis.

```query
tag:#triage/important
```
# \#triage/priority
The reading or project aligns with my [[12 Most Interesting Questions|most interesting questions]] and is a [[current priorities|current priority]]. Readings or projects triaged to this level will receive the majority of my attention. A source with this triage level will be foundational work that requires a deep understanding. This will involve a [[Rhetorical Précis]], quotations, synthesis, and occasional re-visiting of the text.

```query
tag:#triage/priority
```
