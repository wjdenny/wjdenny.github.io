> [!summary] Summary
> Flowerdew and Miller took an ethnographic approach to identify strategies used by 30 Hong Kong students enrolled in an undergraduate TESOL course. The study concludes with advice for instructors and students, but provides no evidence as to their effectiveness.

## Notes
> Various approaches have been adopted in investigating second language lecture comprehension. [...] One approach is a discourse analysis one. The aim here is to describe the structure of lecture discourse so s to provide ESL professionals with models on which to base ESL instructional materials. [...] Another approach is a psycholinguistic one, the aim here being to test out hypotheses concerning language processing in relation to second language lecture comprehension. [...] Chaudron and Richards (1986) [...] the effect of discourse markers on the comprehension of lectures [...] Griffiths (1990) [...] the effect of lecture delivery rate on comprehension. 
> 
> A third approach to second language lecture comprehension research is what might be called **a learner strategies approach. Here, data on the listening processes of effective and less effective listeners is elicited from experimental subjects by means of "think-aloud" or written "on-line" protocols.** The results of learner strategy research can be used to train less effective listeners to use the strategies employed by the more effective listeners. Malley, Chamot and Kupper (1989) employed a think-aloud procedure to determine types of processing strategy and differences between strategies used by good and weak listeners in listening to academic language tasks. Rost (undated) used listener summaries of lectures to identify processes in effective and less effective listeners.

Learner strategies approaches to lecture comprehension research has its limitations. It would only be able to collect the strategies that students feel comfortable sharing. This would likely either exclude or underrepresent strategies that run counter to the expectations of the institution such as academic dishonesty. It also does nothing to separate the effect of confounding variables such as socio-economic status, family history of academia, family history with the target language, and access to mentors within the institution.

> A final approach is an ethnographic one. Benson (1989) investigated the listening activities of one overseas student at a U.S. university over one course, examining his notebooks, together with interviews and recordings of the lectures. This procedure led to insights concerning the processes the subject was involved in in relation to the subject matter and the teacher. For example, the subject was more concerned with integrating new information with knowledge he already had and relating to the teacher's viewpoint than he was with acquiring new facts. The results of this research were used to refute the view of listening as an autonomous process in isolation from other knowledge and skills and to support an argument for preparatory listening programmes based on content subjects.

Similar to a learner strategies approach, the ethnographic approach would also have limitations related to what the subject chooses to disclose and confounding variables.

The studies mentioned in this article, including this study itself, also face limitations in the sample of the population they've studied. Do all Hong Kong TESOL students use the same strategies as non-TESOL Hong Kong students? Do these students use the same strategies as Congolese nursing students?

At best, these two approaches give us a direction to study further.

This would be an interesting poll question to ask students after a lesson (but I wouldn't think it would be generalizable to all ESL students.)

> Three main problems were identified by students in the lectures: speed of delivery, new terminology and concepts, difficulties in concentrating, and problems related to physical environment.

These were identified through ethnographic study-- I was looking more for cognitive science or a psychological approach.

> Reasons given for this difficulty with speed of delivery included unfamiliarity with listening to native speakers:
> > S21 (diary): In my secondary school, all the English teachers are Chinese, there was no chance for me to talk with foreigners.
> ...
> > S21 (interview): I have to translate his English into Chinese so it takes many time to catch his meaning.

> In other cases the problems posed by new ideas could demotivate student from even wanting to listen:
> 
> > S3 (diary): The ideas are very difficult and I have no interest to listen to it at all!

> A third area of difficulty for students was concentration:
> > S4 (diary): Because I did not concentrate too much I missed some points.
> > S19 (diary): I sometimes aware of myself in day-dreaming and I failed to catch up with the new teaching points.
> 
> Reasons given for difficulties in concentration were as follows:
> 
> Difficulty in maintaining concentration over a long period
> 
> > S4 (diary): The first part is too long with no break, it makes me very difficult to concentrate in the two hour lesson.
> 
> Lack of alternative stimulus to monologue:

> > S19 (diary): It is hard to concentrate in the lesson with only one mode of stimulus i.e. lecturing.

There is limited evidence that alternating modes of delivery in classroom instruction (e.g., lecture, video, group work, etc.) may help ESL students better comprehend lectures in English.

> In answer to the question, "How do you solve these (listening) problems?", a number of students identified pre- and/or post-reading of the prescribed text as helpful.

> Responses to various interview questions referred to peer help.

> Only one of the students interviewed admitted to asking questions during the lectures. A reluctance to ask questions during the lectures was related by one student to the Chinese sensibility. [...] Lecturer/tutor help was given a lower priority than peer help.

There is a strong cultural preference among students in China to avoid asking questions in class, and instead ask their classmates.

> Concentration and the value of concentration were something the students were very much aware of. Although concentration was a problem for many students, they nevertheless tried to remedy this problem by concentrating harder [...]

> Ironically, concentration was noted as being easier when understanding was taking place
> 
> A high level of concentration was seen by one student as being fulfilling in itself.

> For most, note-taking was difficult:
> > S21 (interview): (in answer to the question, "How would you solve these (listening) problems?") Make notes and mark the main points in the chapter, but it's very time consuming.

> The results of the study provide a number of lessons for those involved with students having to cope with lectures in a second language. For content lecturers some of these lessons might be as follows:
> - modify the language of presentation and keep new terms and concepts to a reasonable load for each lecture
> - provide a glossary of the new terms and concepts for each lecture
> - provide an outline or notes of the main points of the lecture
> - reduce the lecture time or chunk the lecture into several sections and provide a break between each chunk
> - provide more variety in presenting the lecture material,
> - use those discourse strategies, visual aids, etc. which students preferred to as positive in this study
> - give overt explanations about the purpose of the lecture, indicate when the set text is being referred to and when the lecture is going outside the text, when basic facts are being presented and when personal opinions
> - provide plenty of background knowledge and indicate to students how lecture content relates to their background knowledge
> - encourage student participation
> - get feedback from students on lecturing effectiveness

For my students in particular, their "background knowledge" would most often be grammar in their L1.

> When planning courses, study skills can be included along with content objectives.
> 
> - take notes from five minute piece of monologue
> - highlight the main propositions from their notes
> - write a summary from notes
> - ask and respond to questions

> The investigation demonstrated that some students were using appropriate strategies in trying to comprehend the lectures. Learners should be encouraged to apply and develop these strategies further by means of some sort of learner strategy training (O'Malley, and Chamot, 1990).

This study provided no evidence that these methods are effective at all; just that one or two students used them. Were those students successful in the course? That seems like important information to make such a claim.
