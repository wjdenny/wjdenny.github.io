## Notes
> by 2065, more than a third (36%) of the U.S. population will be immigrants and their U.S.-born children (Budiman, 2020). [page 1]

[[It is estimated that over a third of the United States population will be first and second generation immigrants by 2065]]

> Among immigrants, Asians are the fastest growing group. They accounted for 28% of the new arrivals in 2018, and will surpass Hispanics to become the largest immigrant group by 2055 (Budiman, 2020). [page 1]

> The continuous influx of Asian immigrants, together with ongoing anti-Asian sentiments (Tessler et al., 2020) makes it increasingly important to understand the mental health issues of this population. [page 1]

> Among many factors that influence mental health, neighborhood is an important context and social determinant of health for Asian immigrants. Like other ethnic minority groups, Asian Americans tend to cluster in neighborhoods with high ethnic concentration and strong ethnic ties (i.e. ethnic enclaves) (Logan et al., 2002). [page 1]

> A social foundation of such ethnic neighborhoods that is believed to benefit the health of their residents is social capital (Yang et al., 2020). Generally defined as a stock of social connections and resources embedded in interpersonal relationships (Furstenberg & Kaplan, 2004), social capital provides trust, reciprocity, and shared value for immigrants, and can be transformed to tangible resources (e.g. information, support exchanges), promoting immigrants' economic, social, and psychological well-being (Almeida et al., 2009). [page 1]

> Most immigrant studies on health implications of living in ethnic enclaves are based on Latino populations (Hong et al., 2014). ==It is widely believed that Latino health paradox---that despite their low SES, Latinos have better than expected health outcomes---is partially attributive to strong social capital and migrant network inherent in Latino ethnic enclaves (Weden et al., 2017).== [page 1]

Researchers reported understanding very little about the mental health of Asian American immigrants. There must be a lot of opportunity to study Sudanese-American immigrants also.

[[Some studies suggest that the benefits of living in ethnic enclaves offset the disadvantages of associated low socio-economic status]]

> In a recent review article, ==White and Lawrence (2019) described competing mechanisms through which neighborhood racial/ ethnic density may have both deleterious and salubrious effect on immigrants' mental health.== On the one hand, ==highly segregated neighborhoods are often characterized by poor economic and physical environments such as high poverty concentration, community disinvestment, physical decay, and safety concerns, all of which may be associated with heightened psychosocial stress and increased mental health risks (White & Lawrence, 2019)==. Related to poor economic environments, ==highly segregated neighborhoods may also have limited resources of mental health services (Dinwiddie et al., 2013).== This affects service availability and quality of care, likely resulting in service underutilization and poorer mental health outcomes (White & Lawrence, 2019). However, on the other hand, living in ethnically dominated neighborhoods may facilitate access to information, affordable housing, language brokering, informal care, and culturally sensitive services, consequently promoting the mental health of their residents (Scheppers et al., 2006). Living in neighborhoods with people sharing the same cultural background may also reduce exposure to direct racial discrimination and provide buffer against acculturation related stress (Bécares et al., 2009; Jurcik et al., 2013). [page 1--2]

> Kawachi and Berkman (2001) argued that the underlying mechanism between racial/ethnic density and health is comparable to the pathways between social capital and health. [page 2]

> Despite of lack of an agreement on how to measure social capital (Yang et al., 2020), the concept emphasizes resources embedded in social relations rather than indivduals and its potential benefits are viewed as inherently the results of interaction with other people (Dinda, 2008). A variety of indicators such as social support, social engagement, and neighborhood cohesion have been used to tap on the multifaceted social capital in ethnic enclaves. Adopting the social network framework, some scholars have used social support to operationalize the social capital concept among immigrant populations (Ryan et al., 2008). [page 2]

> Social support in the family is one of the richest source of social capital for older immigrants, many of whom migrate for family reasons, live in multigenerational households, and rely heavily on their family members for adaptation and adjustment to the host society (Treas, 2008). [page 2]

> In the neighborhood context, studies have shown that increasing percentage of co-ethnics in the neighborhood was assoicaetd with bigger social network and an increased likelihood of obtaining emotional and instrumental support among Latinos (Almeida et al., 2009; Lee, 2009). [page 2]

> While social support within the family and the co-ethnics may speak to ‘bonding' social capital, which is based on exclusive social ties built around homogeneity, social integration and social cohesion speak to the ‘bridging' social capital that involves voluntary associations and wider social relations that link individuals to the larger society (Putnam, 1993, 2007). [page 2]

> With regard to immigrants, social integration is generally defined as inclusion of immigrants in the primary social relationships and social networks in the host society (Tselios et al., 2015), whereas social cohesion indicates that all groups of society members have a sense of belonging, inclusion, engagement, trust, and legitimacy (Spoonley et al., 2005). Social integration and social cohesion are important components of immigrant's social capital by helping them access resources in the wider society and promoting economic and social development (Cheong et al., 2007). [page 2]

> Social engagement may be particularly beneficial for older immigrants who often experience disrupted and reduced social network (Guo et al., 2018). [page 2]

> A study showed that a higher Latino composition in the neighborhood was related to greater social integration and cohesion among Latino immigrants (Viruell-Fuentes et al., 2013). [page 2]

> Given the paramount protective role of social capital in ethnic enclaves, a few studies found that social capital advantages available in ethnic neighborhoods may outweigh the socioeconomic disadvantages in these neighborhoods (Eschbach et al., 2004; Gerst et al., 2011; Shell et al., 2013). [page 2]

> two studies based on Hispanic populations concluded social capital indicators such as neighborhood cohesion or integration were not mediators between ethnic density and better mental health outcomes (Flores et al., 2022; Lee & Liechty, 2015). [page 2]

> Although a burgeoning literature exists on neighborhood racial/ethnic density and mental health, the findings are highly inconclusive. Shell et al.'s study on Mexican Americans in Texas (2013) found that higher Hispanic density was associated with fewer depressive symptoms. Using data from National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS), Nobles et al. (2017) also reported that residential segregation was associated with less mental distress. However, another NLAAS-based study found that greater ethnic density was associated with poorer self-rated mental health (Hong et al., 2014). Studies also reported null (Arévalo et al., 2015) or a curvilinear relationship (Denton et al., 2016) between ethnic density and depression. In addition, there is also evidence of divergent mental health implication of ethnic density by race (Mair et al., 2010; Vogt Yuan, 2007), ethnicity (Bécares, 2014; Lee, 2009), and immigrant status (Denton et al., 2015; Lee, 2009). Despite the mixed findings on Hispanic populations in general, large-scale national studies using cross-sectional (Gerst et al., 2011; Ostir et al., 2003) or longitudinal data (Flores et al., 2022) consistently reported salubrious effect of high neighborhood ethnic density on lower depression among older Hispanics. [page 2]

Do older immigrants benefit more from neighborhood ethnic density than younger immigrants? It seems plausible. I think how much the individual identifies with and feels comfortable around their co-ethnics would play a role; for example, queer immigrants may feel more threatened in an ethnic enclave if the culture is significantly anti-queer. Queer could also be a range of things, basically just not the norm in that culture.

> Only a handful of studies focused on Asian Americans, and the findings are also equivocal. Using the NLAAS data, one study found that greater Asian density was associated with poorer self-rated mental health (Hong et al., 2014). By contrast, two other studies suggested protective effect of living in neighborhood with high Asian density, but only for certain outcomes and in certain subgroups of Asian Americans (i.e. decreased chances of mood dysfunction among men, Leu, 2011; lower stress among recent immigrants, Morey et al., 2020). Two studies further reported lack of association between ethnic density and depression among Asian immigrants (Mair et al., 2010; Roh et al., 2011). The mixed findings point to the importance of examining specific ethnicity/immigrant subgroups in understanding neighborhood ethnic density on minority mental health (White & Lawrence, 2019). [page 2]

> Chinatowns in North America are fairly segregated urban residential and commercial areas that often have overall community organizations coordinating kinship, clanship, hometown, local, or regional associations (Wong & Tan, 2013). Traditional Chinatowns in the Unites States formed in the midto late-1900 century as a response to racial discrimination and hardship encountered by Chinese immigrants to provide services (e.g. restaurants, grocery stores, laundry), mutual aid, and protection to fellow ethnic Chinese (Yamashita, 2013). While contemporary Chinese immigrants with higher socioeconomic status tend to settle in the suburbs, Chinatowns still serve as important sources of economic opportunities, social support, and cultural maintenance for new immigrants and immigrant with lower socioeconomic positions (Yamashita, 2013). For its residents, Chinatown function as agents of acculturation by providing employment assistance, language brokerage, social and health care services, and recreational activities (Wong & Tan, 2013). [page 3]

> Given that less than 1% of the respondents were born in the United State, they were excluded from the analysis, yielding the working sample of 3,105 respondents who were foreign-born (i.e. immigrants). [page 3]

> Depression was assessed by Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) (Kroenke et al., 2001). [page 3]

> QoL was rated by the respondents as 1 = poor, 2 = fair, 3 = good, 4 = very good, and was recoded into a dummy variable indicating good/very good QoL (1 = yes, 0 = no). [page 3]

> Social Capital included family support, friend support, social engagement, neighborhood cohesion, and perceived neighborhood environment. Family and friend support was assessed by four questions drawn from the Health and Retirement Study (Juster & Suzman, 1995). Respondents reported the extent to which they liked to (1) open up to family, and (2) rely on family for help (1 = hardly ever, 2 = some of the time, 3 = often). The questions were repeated regarding friends. Because most of the respondents reported ‘often' for all the items, two dummy variables were created to indicate whether the respondent perceived strong family/friend support (1 = yes, 0 = no), if the answers were ‘3 = often' for both questions in the domain. Social engagement assessed the respondents' frequency of participating in eight leisure activities in the community (going out to a movie/restaurant/sport event, visiting friends/neighbors, having friends over for a dinner, going on trips, visiting a museum, attending a concert, visiting a library, visiting a community center) on a five-point Likert scale (Dong et al., 2014b). Sum scores were calculated (α = .64). [page 3]

> Neighborhood cohesion was measured by six questions assessing frequency that the respondents (1) see neighbors talk outside, (2) take care of each other, (3) watch out for each other, (4) the number of neighbors they know by name, (5) have a friendly talk with once a week, and (6) could call on for assistance (Cagney et al., 2009). Given that the first three items were measured on a three-point Likert scale (0 = never, 1 = rarely, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often) and the last three items were measured on a five-point-Likert scale (0 = none, 1 = 1–5, 2 = 6–10, 3 = 11–15, 4 = 16–20, 5 = 21 or more), each item was first converted to a Z-score and then averaged to create a composite score (α = .86). Perceived neighborhood environment was measured by eight questions assessing how frequently the respondents saw/experienced (1) trash/litter, (2) vandalism, (3) unknown people walking around, (4) loud noise, (5) unsafe traffic conditions, (6) unsafe to walk around, (7) poorly maintained sidewalks, and (8) inadequate lighting at night in the neighborhood on a 4-point scale (0 = Never, 1 = Rarely, 2 = Sometimes, 3 = Often) (Cagney et al., 2009). All the items were first reversely coded and then summed up to indicate favorable perception of neighborhood environment (α = .80). [page 3--4]

> We also controlled for living arrangement (living alone, living with spouse only, living in multigenerational household, and others) and residential tenure (years in the neighborhood) when assessing social capital. [page 4]

> Negative binomial regressions were used because depression was highly skewed and thus treated as a count variable. [page 4]

> Chinatown residents were significantly older, more likely to be widowed, and were predominantly Cantonese (59%) or Taishanese (32%) speakers. On average, Chinatown residents had much lower education (more than 3-year difference) and were more likely to report functional limitations. Although Chinatown residents had lived in the U.S. for longer time (21 vs. 18 years), they reported significantly lower level of acculturation. Chinatown residents were more likely to live alone, but the two groups did not differ significantly in perceived family support. Despite longer stay in the neighborhood (13 vs. 10 yrs.), Chinatown residents fared less well in most neighborhood social capital indicators: despite reporting more neighborhood cohesion, they were significantly less likely to report strong friend support, had lower levels of social engagement, and perceived their neighborhood environment less favorably. The two groups also differed significantly in the two outcomes. Although Chinatown residents had significantly fewer depressive symptoms than non-Chinatown residents, they were less likely to report good/very good QoL. [page 4]

> When adjusting the control variables (Model 1), Chinatown residence was not associated with depression (β = −.108, p = .11), suggesting that the bivariate observation of Chinatown residents' more depressive symptoms (Table 1) may be partially attributed to group differences in socio-demographic, physical health, and immigration-related variables. [page 4]

> When family-level social capital indicators were further adjusted (Model 2), the association between Chinatown residence and depression remained to be non-significant (β = −.093, p = .017). In Model 2, strong family support was associated with fewer depressive symptoms (β = −.249, p < .001). [page 4]

> In Model 3, neighborhood-level social capital indicators were adjusted in addition to control variables. The results showed that living in Chinatown was associated with significantly fewer depressive symptoms and all the social capital indicators were significantly associated with fewer depressive symptoms (β = −.139, p < .05). Given that Chinatown residents overall fared less well on neighborhood social capital indicators (Table 1), the findings suggest a possible suppression effect of low social capital of Chinatown residents, that is, if having comparable social capital as non-Chinatown residents, Chinatown residents would have reported even fewer depressive symptoms. [page 4]

> When adjusting both family- and neighborhood-level social capital indicators (Model 4), Chinatown residence was associated with fewer depressive symptoms and the association was marginally significant (β = −.137, p = .057). Variance inflation factors (VIF) ranged from 1.095 to 2.794 in Model 4, indicating that multicollinearity is not a major concern in the analyses. [page 4]

> Table 3 summarizes logistic regression results on quality of life (QoL). Different from results on depression, Chinatown residence was consistently associated with a lower likelihood of reporting good/very good QoL across all the models. Results from Model 2 showed that living with family members (OR = 1.374, CI: 1.039– 1.834 for living with spouse only; OR = 1.451, CI: 1.105–1.905 for multigenerational household) and having strong family support (OR = 1.624, CI: 1.390–1.900) were associated with a higher chance of reporting good/very good QoL. Model 3 further showed that strong friend support (OR = 2.564, CI: 2.070–3.177), high social engagement (OR = 1.066, CI: 1.041–1.091), and positive neighborhood perception (OR = 1.039, CI: 1.016–1.061) were associated with a higher likelihood of reporting good/very good QoL. Although Chinatown residents were ranked lower on all the three indicators (Table 1), controlling for such differences didn't fully explain the negative association between Chinatown residence and QoL (OR = 0.797, CI: 0.661–0.962). The results of the full model remained largely the same. [page 4--5]

> we found it imperative to understand the ‘inherent' differences between those who live in ethnic enclaves and those who don't. In our study, compared to non-Chinatown residents, Chinatown residents were disadvantaged in many aspects including advanced age, poorer health, and low socioeconomic status and acculturation level (despite of longer residence in the U.S.). Together, these factors may have formed their decision of where to live (e.g. Chinatown vs. suburb) in the first place. In this sense, it's difficult to discern whether it's where they live that makes a difference in their mental health, or it's who they are that influences where they live as well as their health outcomes. Such potential self-selection effect needs to be borne in mind when examining the health implications of ethnic enclave residence. [page 5]

> For depression, which is the most extensively examined outcome, although the overall crude association between Chinatown residence and depression was negative, it did not reach statistical significance after adjusting for social capital and control variables. [page 5--6]


> The finding is consistent with those from Mair et al. (2010), indicating a small and marginal protective effect of high ethnic density on depressive symptoms. It's likely that other explanatory variables that are not included in the analyses such as access to culturally sensitive mental health services available in Chinatown areas accounted for the potential protective effect. [page 6]

> In another study based on the same dataset (i.e. PINE), it was reported that living in Chinatown was associated with a higher likelihood of seeking mental health help from informal sources (relative to not seeking help at all) (Kong et al., 2021). [page 6]

> The contrasting findings on depression versus QoL demonstrate the importance of including additional indicators of psychological well-being besides depression in fully understanding the complex influence of neighborhood structural context on minority health. Compared to depression, quality of life is a much broader assessment of one's overall life situation, encompassing not only psychological, but also social and economic well-being (Fallowfield, 2009). The robust negative association between Chinatown residence and QoL may indicate the overall low socioeconomic resources/ status of Chinatown residents that may partly have prevented them from moving out of the Chinatown. [page 6]

> Some scholars also distinguished ethnic enclaves, which is supposed to be a transitional and temporary living arrangement for new immigrants, from ethnic communities, which is a result of personal intention (Logan et al., 2002). Being segregated from the mainstream society may limit Chinatown residents' acculturation progress and access to economic, informational, and social opportunities available in racially integrated areas that may facilitate upward mobility in the long run (Yang et al., 2020). Thus, it's likely that Chinatown residents may have a sense of ‘left behind' or ‘being stuck', both in space and time, compared to their counterparts living in other areas of Chicago, and consequently have poorer assessment of their overall quality of life. [page 6]

> One surprising finding of this study is---contrary to the widely held belief of high social capital inherent in ethnic enclaves such as Chinatowns (Wong & Tan, 2013), Chinese older immigrants living in Chicago Chinatown had overall lower social capital in domains of friend support, social engagement, and perceived neighborhood environment than their counterparts living in other parts of Chicago. Together with the lower socioeconomic status and acculturation level of the Chinatown residents, the results seem to reflect the pattern of compound disadvantage---that disadvantaged persons living in disadvantaged neighborhoods (Wheaton & Clarke, 2003). [page 6]

> Together, the personal and neighborhood attributes of Chinatown residents in this study likely predispose them to high mental health risks. [page 6--7]

> Social disorganization theory states that poorer neighborhood environment erodes positive social resources and processes in the community and engenders fear and disconnection among residents (Almeida et al., 2009). When residents experience public deviance such as the presence of litter, vandalism, and unknown people walking around, they tend to retreat socially and psychologically from their communities (Aneshensel et al., 2011). The poorer perception of Chinatown neighborhood environment captured many factors mentioned above, possibly hindering its residents' engagement in support exchanges and leisure activities in the neighborhood. [page 7]

Is social disorganization theory the same as the broken window theory?

> The lower SES of Chinatown residents may also play a role. Studies have shown unequal distribution of social capital resources across SES (Furstenberg & Kaplan, 2004). The social network of individuals of lower SES may be limited to individuals of lower SES as well, which may not be readily translated into greater support exchanges as in high-SES networks do (Furstenberg & Kaplan, 2004). [page 7]

> Lastly, Chinatown residents were also more likely to live alone, which is an additional challenge that may lead to social isolation and less engagement in the community (Fung, 2016). [page 7]

[[Living alone contributes to feelings of isolation and lack of community engagement.]]

> Due to small numbers of respondents living in other neighborhoods besides Chinatown, we were not able to calculate ethnic density as most prior studies did. Treating Chinatown residence as a binary variable likely overlooked the heterogeneity among the non-Chinatown neighborhoods. [page 7]

> The findings of this study highlight the importance of parceling out self-selection bias and individual predispositions that shape neighborhood selection as well as individual well-being when examining the health implications of ethnic neighborhoods. [page 7]

> These findings point to the importance of intervention at the mezzo level to improve the psychological wellbeing of this population. It is necessary to enhance ethnic neighborhood's safety and walkability to boost the social capital and sense of thriving among their residents. The finding is helpful to inform the development of tailored programs to focus on improving social support, social engagement, neighborhood cohesion among enclave residents who are foreign-born.
