### Examining How Implicit Bias May Affect Teaching  
**Santiba D. Campbell, PhD; Associate Professor, Psychology; Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences; Bennett College** 
One of the basic ideas or definitions of thinking about your implicit bias is that it's internal. So it becomes very problematic because you may not be aware that you're even bringing these biases to the situation. So you can imagine in a classroom setting, this is a very big deal because you might be projecting or making an assumption about a student that you consciously aren't even aware that you're doing.

So when thinking about actionable items, what can we actually do to address our implicit biases? Number one: Critically reflect who are you, how do you see yourself, and how do you see others? That's at the heart of this. Once we do that, it's reading, it's talking to people in our circles who are trusted, who will be honest with us. Right? One of the things that we often talk about inclusive education is that if you haven't heard about your students' challenges, then they don't trust you to tell them perhaps. And so how can we make sure that we are being open, that we are providing opportunities for relationships to form with our students so that they can tell us and they can be honest and share with us?  

[[The first step to managing implicit biases is to reflect on them and to get feedback from other people]]

I think identity is really important to be aware of. You know, where you come from, where those, where your ideas come from, where your morals come from, where your belief systems come from. . . So you understand why you might think certain things in the classroom or towards students. And, you know, really looking at myself now identifying as a white male, you know, how does that really impact my teaching of my students and especially my students of color. You know, my students with different backgrounds and belief systems, how, how do I really make sure that their voices are heard in my classroom and not silenced because of my belief system or my viewpoints on the world?

When I was growing up, I was in a small town and, you know, it was made up of White, Black, Hispanic. But I found myself mainly surrounded in school with White peers. And unconsciously, I think I equated White with smarter. And then I got to college and that was really challenged. And I realized that I just, you know, had this misperception that that White equals smart, which just isn't true.

I think it's really important as an instructor to think about where these thoughts about my students' capabilities or my students' performance coming from. And it is this rooted in some kind of unconscious bias? Do I treat one set of students a very specific way than I treat a different set of students?

So why is the student falling asleep in my class? Well, they don't care. Well, it could be that they just worked a night shift and they're really tired and they are the primary earners for their families.

A professor may walk into a classroom and notice one of the athletes. Maybe they're noticing someone on a football team. And from an implicit bias standpoint, they may automatically assume that the athlete's not going to take the class seriously or this athlete is only concerned with their sport as opposed to not realizing that this is a scholar athlete with a 4.0 GPA.

We need to get rid of deficit thinking in thinking about our students. So get rid of all deficit thinking. It's not productive, it's not useful, and it's not benefiting you or your students. So instead of thinking what your students aren't bringing or how they are under-prepared or not prepared, get all of this language out of your vocabulary and **think about, what do my students know, what are they bringing into the classroom**? And so even that shift in framing is an important shift because then you are thinking about opportunities and not challenges.   ^67da86

In the beginning of the semester, I like to let my students know that I don't know everything in a class. So if I'm using an asset-based teaching style, that shows them they have knowledge that they're bringing to the table the same way I'm bringing it to the table too. **An asset-based mindset involves meeting the students where they are and focusing on things that they've already accomplished, or understand, or are good at.** Because with a deficit-based model, you're coming in there assuming that the students don't know anything and that they're probably behind in the topic that you're trying to share. So if you go in and think of it moreso as the asset, you can work on value and what the students already have to bring to the table.  ^25698c

**Breonna, Student, Bennett College**
I don't feel like I have to live up to somebody's expectations, regardless of how I am. I literally can come as I am and she takes all of us and she just adapts to how we are. And that's the one thing that I really love about taking her class and actually really love about her.

Today, I would like us to look over this document I created about providing me some feedback to make this course more inclusive. 

**Beck A. Munsey, PhD, NCC, LPC-S** 
Asking students for feedback is a really important part of my practice as a professor and as a counselor. I think it's really important that we ask for feedback, even maybe after our syllabi. How do you feel the syllabus is inclusive or exclusive of ideas for this semester? Or authors this semester. Or you as a student, did I leave something out that I should have put in the syllabus? Or is there an author you would have really liked to see on the syllabus that maybe we could add as not required reading for the semester, but some elective reading this semester so that students are aware of this resource?  

**Beck A. Munsey, PhD, NCC, LPC-S**
I really value y'all's opinion and so I would really like to take a moment, about five to ten minutes to fill out this form. And then I'm gonna invite y'all for those that want to say anything about the feedback they're giving aloud after we take some time.

In the last year or so, I've also been doing a survey that I've sent out either two or three times a semester, and it's been anonymous where I asked students to identify ways that they feel the course, the content, or myself as the instructor is being inclusive and affirming of all students. And what are ways that the content or things that I've done have not been inclusive and interfered with people's learning? And what else they would like me to do differently. And I focused in on that because I'm trying to address, address issues that I'm not aware of or that I do without recognizing that, that might hold up either a White ideal, or an ablest ideal, or some ideal that is missing the experience for some students and that is not reflective of who we are as a, as a larger society.  

**Beck A. Munsey, PhD, NCC, LPC-S** 
I want to also understand, too, about my assignments. How do you feel the assignments are inclusive of all learning? You know, what part of your learning, the way that you perform or the way that you show that you've learned something would be a better assignment to capture, capture that. And a lot of times I get some really good feedback and I ask for those anonymously as well.  

**Marlene, Student, Tarleton State University**
I felt that he truly wanted to represent me. Me as a woman in college, me as a Mexican-American, me as a daughter of immigrants. And he really made it a point for each of us to talk to him and allow him to be inclusive. And if we felt that he wasn't, he would take feedback on, you know, what we would like to see more.

**Katherine McCarthy, PhD, LCSW** 
I've definitely gotten feedback in the past that I should ask for pronouns more frequently than I had been. So that's part of why I do this more frequently than I used to. I've had student feedback that they wanted more diverse examples in class assignments. And so that's part of the reason why I make an effort to do that more. So, and then a lot of the feedback has been very positive. 

**Joe, Student, Indiana University School of Social Work**
An example in the feedback that I shared, I would say I was very, like, encouraged when she included sort of CBT working with LGBTQ clients. It's like personal to me. And the more I look back too, the more I realize how much, like, learning about critical race theory really expanded who I was as a person.  

**Katherine McCarthy, PhD, LCSW**
I have it as a regular part of my course now because I want there to be this ongoing anonymous opportunity to try to alter the power dynamics also, and to make more space for that and to show that a part of good reflective practice, especially in social work, is seeking and receiving feedback to better myself and the course.  

**Kristina Ruiz-Mesa, PhD** 
I think it's less about whether we are good or bad people and how can we be good thinkers? How can we make sure that our thinking is clear, that it is logical, that it is informed in an empathetic manner. And I think that is at the core of what we need to do as educators to challenge ourselves to be better, to be inclusive, to make sure that our classrooms are spaces where all students can share their experiences, can share their knowledge, can share their history, and can feel heard, valued, and included.
