Linguistic minority students are largely invisible in research on underrepresented populations in higher education because they are often grouped together with the first-generation and ethnic minority groups to which many belong.

This issue is a subset of the more general issue where [[Linguistic minority students are often not as visible as other groups]]

There's the saying, "What gets measured, gets managed" when discussing goals and performance; but something similar can be said for linguistic minority students in this case. **Those who get measured get supported.**
