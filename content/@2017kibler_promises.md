## Notes
> Deborah Brandt (1998, 2001) is a well-known literacy scholar in composition studies who examines how various "literacy sponsors" shape writers' practices in schools, communities, and workplaces. [page 99]

>but as I demonstrate through other students' experiences, there can be a mismatch between sponsors and students' goals that can hinder academic success. [page 100]

What sponsors and counter-sponsors are available for our linguistic minority students at each level?

> Brandt (1998) defines "literacy sponsors" as:
> 
> > Any agents, local, or distant, concrete or abstract, who enable, support, teach, model, as well as recruit, regulate, suppress, or withhold literacy-- and gain advantage by it in some way. Just as the ages of radio and television accustom us to having programs *brought* to us by various commercial sponsors, it is useful to think about who or what underwrites occasions of literacy learning and use. Although the interests of the sponsor and the sponsored do not have to converge (and, in fact, may conflict) sponsors nevertheless set the terms for access to literacy and wield powerful incentives for compliance and loyalty. (p. 167)

So, anything that helps or hinders literacy events and learning? I don't quite understand this metaphor. In what way are "literacy sponsors" paying for advertising space in literacy events?

> Literacy sponsors can include a range of institutions, individuals, and objects [page 100]

> Laursen and Fabrin (2013), for example, found that teachers and other adults can both support students' writing and act as gatekeepers or "counter-sponsors" who prevent access to or otherwise impede literacy learning. At the same time, students who are "sponsored" are also able to exert agency, in that individuals can engage in "corralling of sponsorship forces" (Brandt, 2001, p. 69) to serve their own ends, and decide, when offered a sponsoring relationship, whether to affiliate or not, and then whether to assimilate, appropriate, or reject the relationship (Donehower, 2013). [page 101]

> Access to sponsorship is often stratified by individuals' and communities' political, social, and economic privilege, which can either facilitate or limit access to meaningful and plentiful contacts with powerful literacy sponsors (Brandt, 1998). In relation to multilingual writers specifically, literacy resources acquired through sponsorship may be inconsistently valued across contexts. For example, in comparing the case of Dora Lopez (a Spanish-English bilingual) with that of a monolingual English speaker from the same community in *Literacy in American Lives* (2001), Brandt argues that Dora's Spanish language and literacy resources-- which were carefully sponsored and developed by her family-- lost value when shifting from the home sphere to school, play, and work contexts that required English. Technology can serve to reinforce these devaluations, rather than alleviate them, as Pederson (2010) found in Jordanian academics' limited use of Arabic even as part of their email and Internet work routines.

> Sponsorship is a uniquely appropriate means of investigating writing specifically. Brandt (2001) found that writing sponsors were far scarcer than reading sponsors, especially in home but also in school contexts. And for multilinguals, institutional sponsorship of home or minority language writing, even in officially bilingual educational institutions, appears to be even more elusive (Gentil, 2005; Kibler, 2014). [page 101]

We're expected to consume literacy products moreso than produce them.

> Schooling institutions' tracking and placement policies seem to offer important sponsorship (or more often counter-sponsorship) of multilingual writers labeled as "English language learners" or "ESL" that appears to significantly impact transitions. I**n high school, such students may be placed in tracks that preclude them from taking college-preparatory courses (Callahan & Shifrer, 2012; Kanno & Cromley, 2013),** which are necessary to access university and gain the literacy expertise that helps students avoid remedial or ESL placements in college or university (Bunch & Endris, 2012). Such placements, aside from carrying the stigma of "re-becoming ESL" (Ortmeier-Hooper, 2008), can also be problematic because of **trends that show students' limited progress through remedial or ESL courses at community colleges (e.g., Patthey-Chavez, Thomas-Spiegel, & Dillon, 2009)**. [page 101--102]

Are they saying students who get re-labeled as ESL lose motivation? Administrators of these programs often claim the programs exist to support students, but I don't understand why we can't both support them and allow them to continue with their usual classes. We may be confusing support for containment.

[[Evidence shows students often fail to progress through remedial English coursework in community colleges.]]

> Yet, successful literacy sponsorships have also been documented. These include the skillful pedagogical practices of a writing teacher to support multilingual and multiliterate practices and identities (Skerrett, 2013); multiple, dynamic, and multilingual adult and peer sponsorships in support of an adolescent's school-based writing in English over time (Kibler, 2014); and adolescents' self- and peer-sponsored use of technology to navigate and develop multiple languages and genres (Lam, 2004; Lee, 2006; Yi, 2007) and to develop positive identities (de la Piedra, 2010; Yi, 2013).

> **Harklau and McClanaham (2012) suggest that well-resourced schools, extracurricular programs, churches and religious activities, and families can simultaneously sponsor and counter-sponsor linguistic minority students' access to and success in college.** [page 102]

> Although **it is not possible to achieve true insider status (Heath & Street, 2008)**, my lack of a teacher role, my use of Spanish, and my ongoing communication with students across settings helped me earn trust and gain access to a range of writing practices and artifacts. [page 103]

> Fabiola entered a university writing program that facilitated her progress toward a degree through requiring relatively few courses for students found to be in need of remediation. She had to take only one "remedial" writing course, which was also credit bearing, before entering the typical writing sequence. This allowed her to begin coursework early in her transition in the Gender and Women's Studies Department, her eventual major, and to eventually complete all graduation requirements in four years. [page 106]

> Once in postsecondary institutions, both remained proactive in seeking individual sponsors but also adapted their strategies to produce writing that was valued by their institutions. [page 104]

Ask students, who do you go to when you need help with an assignment? Do they know?

> Along with the amount of writing, Faviola also reported beginning to use her own Spanish abilities to sponsor her drafting process in English. She described how this process began during her second year of college:
>
>> I feel at the beginning of college and in high school, I was scared of just thinking in Spanish. And i feel this [second] year that I really just try to think sentences in Spanish and put them in English. I think this is one of my first years I'm kinda more open in trying to use Spanish. And sometimes when I just had a lot of ideas, I'll just write. And if I can't get a word or a sentence, I'll just write it in Spanish and think about it later-- just to keep writing. (6/21/12)

> The students reacted to this placement differently, however. Diego explained that he blamed his high school for not preparing him better: "I went there, now [they're] telling me that I actually didn't learn the basics things on high school about how to write a paragraph or an essay" (6/29/11). 

like a student I had in L2 ELA Reading/Writing

> Jaime, on the other hand, had a more pragmatic approach. He did not question his placement or high school writing preparation, only saying that he would prefer to be in the upper-level ESL class offered by the college because it offered transferable English credits while his current classes, designed for the general community college population, did not. Diego and Jaime took almost no courses in their planned areas of study during the first two years, which were dominated by English, mathematics, and other elective courses. [page 109]

> Based upon the data, students' abilities in Spanish were not recognized by sponsors or even students themselves as strengths or resources in the transition. [page 111]

> one cannot help but wonder whether Ana's "hands-on" (and anti-writing) identity developed on its own or in response to her restricted postsecondary options. [page 113]

> the extent to which these courses prevented students from progressing more quickly to their postsecondary goals seems to have been problematic, as others have documented (Patthey-Chavez, Thomas-Spiegel, & DIllon, 2009). At the same time, Ana's experiences in the cosmetology program highlight the under-studied but common vocational pathways many resident multilingual youth take, which have their own unique opportunities and challenges that merit further study. [page 113]

> A final observation particularly relevant to this volume is the mismatch between sponsoring institutions and the home language and literacy skills of the multilingual writes in this study, consistent with previous research (Brandt, 2001; Gentil, 2005; Kibler, 2011). From what the data suggest, neither Ana nor Diego nor Fabiola nor Jaime were presented with any postsecondary opportunities to read or write in their home languages or explicit opportunities to draw upon their home language expertise in support of their writing. (Secondary opportunities to do so were present but also very limited, see Kibler, 2009.) [page 113]

> The above analysis also raises provocative questions about how we (as researchers and educators) understand postsecondary education, the role of writing in school and life, and writers themselves. For example, what makes a transition "successful," and whose criteria and time frames are we using? What does "failure" mean in terms of postsecondary transitions, and how does this vary by stakeholder? [page 113--114]

> I also do not provide a full analysis of some larger trends influencing various sponsorships, such as global flows of immigration or workforce demands that make postsecondary education so important tin the first place. [page 114]

> Also intriguing is a possible role of gender in sponsorship and the ways in which women may seek or accept sponsorships for school-based writing differently than men. [page 114]

> Brandt (1998) suggests that although teachers are "neither rich nor powerful enough to sponsor literacy on our own terms, we serve instead as conflicted brokers between literacy's buyers and sellers" (p. 182).  [page 114]

> administrators should recognize individual teacher "support" cannot overcome institutional barriers, particularly postsecondary. [page 114]
