## Rhetorical Précis
%% Review a [description of rhetorical précis from Cuyamaca College](https://www.cuyamaca.edu/student-support/tutoring-center/files/student-resources/rhetorical-precis-description-and-examples.pdf). %%

%%
[Dr. Pacheco-Vega], in [his blog article] titled "[Triaging your reading workload]" ([2019]), argues that [the ways in which we decide when to read an article in more depth can and should vary by individuals and is best learned by experience]. [He] supports this claim by [providing examples of techniques that work for him but others have claimed are not effective as well as vice versa] and finally [encouraging readers to develop their own guidelines for deciding what merits further reading]. [Pachecho-Vega]'s purpose is to [show how to more effectively process reading workloads] in order to [help students and researchers make better decisions about what to read in more depth]. [He] adopts [an informal tone] for the readers of [his blog] and others interested in the topic of [knowledge management].

## Notes

It doesn't get better, but you do get stronger and smarter.

Adjusting to life with chronic illness
- acceptance
- resilience
- lessons (learn all the little quirks of your body)
- support system
- self-protection; don't keep people who drain you

[20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHs8sp6Han0&t=20m18s) She thinks of her "disabled body" separate from her that she has to take care of. She finds it leads to her taking better care of herself than if she simply thought of it as her own body. I've found something similar in that if I think of parts of myself as being like an animal that I take care of, a friend, or a child, then it sort of tricks me into feeling more compassionate towards myself. #topic/chronic-illness
