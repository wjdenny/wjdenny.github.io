Learning to visualize and narrate the data can also help you focus on the problem at hand rather than getting overwhelmed with the details. Two major challenges are in avoiding overplotting and chartjunk. [[Overplotting is a situation where there are too much data represented which causes elements to overlap and become unreadable]] [[Chartjunk is extra decoration on a chart that does not communicate information about the data]] [[Keep the number of elements in a graph to less than 4 to avoid cognitive overload]]
