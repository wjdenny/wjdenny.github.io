Being white is not the same as having a white racial *habitus*. The white habitus[^2], often also called *whiteness*[^1] is described by scholars as a system of beliefs, habits, and cultural mores developed by dominant Northern European cultures. These mores are not exclusive to people identifying with these cultures, however, due to a history of colonial power establishing this culture as the dominant culture in many nations around the world. Non-white people, raised in the same society, learn to center whiteness just as well as white people. In addition, what defines a specific cultural habitus is constantly changing and evolving[^3], similar to how we categorize language and dialect[^4]. Therefore, it is important to distinguish the habitus of a person or a group of people from the people themselves. People can change, but the habitus will seek to reproduce itself[^5]. This parallel with language continues to hold; people can learn additional languages and forget old ones, but the language will continue to be used. Languages can die, though, and one of the ways that can happen is when the utility of the language begins to wane. Perhaps this suggests that a habitus can die when its utility (i.e., ability to confer social power) no longer serves people.
