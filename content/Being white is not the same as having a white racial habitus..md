Being white is not the same as having a white racial *habitus*. The white habitus[^2], often also called *whiteness*[^1] is described by scholars as a system of beliefs, habits, and cultural mores developed by dominant Northern European cultures. These mores are not exclusive to people identifying with these cultures, however, due to a history of colonial power establishing this culture as the dominant culture in many nations around the world. Non-white people, raised in the same society, learn to center whiteness just as well as white people. In addition, what defines a specific cultural habitus is constantly changing and evolving[^3], [[Language is a cultural artifact.|similar to how we categorize language and dialect]]. People can change, but the habitus will seek to reproduce itself through a variety of means[^5]. Therefore, it is important to distinguish the habitus of a person or a group of people from the people themselves.
