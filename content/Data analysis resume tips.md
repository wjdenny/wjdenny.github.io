These are notes from a recorded CareerCon 2019 session, [Live Portfolio and Resume Analysis with Data Science Hiring Managers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBbYhhH399c), and also a little bit from [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics).

Three major points stood out:

- It's important to show a diverse range of experiences,
- use the resume to show effective communication skills and focus, and
- show your work.

## Diversity of experience

Try to show a wide range of different types of projects. Diversity in the tools used, the types of analysis needed, the types of industries, etc. In my case, almost all of my employment experience has to do with education and academia, so taking on data projects for a business, or some field unrelated to my work history might be more helpful than doing another project for the same type of work.

It's also important to let your resume tell a story about the path you've taken to get to where you are. I think this would be even more important if, like me, you're transitioning from one career to another, or have a non-traditional background (i.e., being self-taught, or having a degree in something other than computer science or statistics).

## Communication and focus

You want that story to be clear and focused, even if your path has a few twists and turns. There are a few things that we can do both in how we communicate through the resume, and also in the visual appearance of the document.

First, your resume should have a clear objective of the kind of work you want to do. Imagine being in the hiring manager's position. They need to be able to see exactly what projects you will be most valuable on as soon as possible. This can be accomplished through having a clear objective statement, and also in the selection of projects, work experiences, and academic achievements to be presented.

Most if not all of the statements in your resume should follow a very strict "PAR" format; that is, problem, action, and result; and try to balance brevity with giving just enough detail to make it clear why it's relevant to your work. Let's say I want to include the tech training lessons for low-proficiency English learners in my classes. It's not exactly data analysis, but it we're in transition and it is relevant to our theoretical position.

- **Project**: tech-inexperienced students with limited English language skills
- **Action**: trained
- **Result**: to use online learning management system, email, and OneDrive for their coursework.

From there, we can add some measurement of the impact the action had.

- **trained 12--30 tech-inexperienced students with limited English language skills per semester to use LMS, email, and OneDrive for their coursework**

I'm not saying its perfect, but thinking of resume writing in this way has helped me keep a more focused message throughout.

To this end, including selected coursework in the education section can easily seem like a good idea, but it often is too vague to be of much use to your audience. If you do have a project that you want to show, you can go into more detail in the section on selected projects. Also, you can consider leaving out lower certificates of the same type and show only the highest. For example, if your undergraduate and graduate degree are both in Linguistics, you only really need to show the graduate degree.

In terms of the visual aspect of the resume, there are a few things to consider. For one, it doesn't need to be on a single page; though, if it does require a second page, it should be for a very good reason. If there's more than that, it will likely be ignored. Also, while it's important to document the impact your projects have had on the organizations you've worked for, it's also important to avoid distracting from the overall message with a lot of numbers. Another tip that was demonstrated in one of the resumes the panelists reviewed was the use of bold typeface to draw the eye to key pieces of information, such as the action part of a PAR statement.

In general, it's not necessary to go into much technical detail in the resume. The first person to see it likely is not a technical person themselves, and getting into detail is what the interview process is for. Also, the panelists warned against the overuse of buzzwords, especially if they can't be backed up by evidence in the form of completed projects related to those buzzwords. In short, you want to make sure you are ready to explain why you chose to use that tool and what its limitations are.

## Show evidence

What happens outside your resume is also important. You should always be ready to show evidence of the things you include in your resume. For example, if I'm showcasing programming skills, I should be able to show evidence of code quality. This can and should also go so far as to include links to a GitHub profile or other similar repository of your work. If you're applying for more senior positions, it's also important to show evidence of starting and finishing projects, as these will show essential project management skills like initiative and follow-through.

## Conclusion

Writing a resume is hard, and everyone struggles with it. On top of being an intense exercise in focus and effective communication skills, it is extremely personal. After being a part-time instructor and denied full-time opportunities for so long, I began to feel like I wasn't cut out for a "real job." But, learning how to write a strong resume and spending some time really reflecting on the work I've done, I've begun to see my own value and that many of the setbacks I've experienced in my field say more about the economic and political situation we're in than it does in my abilities. Good luck!
