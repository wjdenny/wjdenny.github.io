# How I actually \*MAKE\* Smart Notes
[[FromSergio]] posted this video on [[YouTube]].

> [!summary] Summary
> FromSergio explains how he handles note-taking and the three types of notes he uses; reference notes, literature notes, and permanent notes.
## Notes
Reference notes are the original quotes from the source material. 
Literature notes are the reader's own interpretation of the source material.

So, I tend to combine reference and literature notes in each source document. I also organize literature notes in maps of content in other documents. FromSergio separates them because he wants to be free to take as many reference notes as he wants, but be very selective about literature notes and wants to keep those brief and easy to see. I could gain those benefits as well while keeping them in the same file if I put reference notes at the bottom and literature notes closer to the top, after the summary, with links to the reference blockquote.

Shorter literature notes are better. It takes more effort to think of a shorter note than a longer one. It requires more thought.

Permanent notes are notes written for a general audience and not directly connected to any particular source.
