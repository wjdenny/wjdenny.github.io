Faculty autonomy is a blessing and a curse when it comes to standardizing course experiences. This has a greater impact on students with diverse education backgrounds.

There is conflict between easing the gate-keeping effect of courses and strict adherence to course competencies. Faculty who recognize the gate-keeping effects of their course grades are more likely to have less strict interpretations of course outcomes.

I suggested that there should be an opportunity for faculty to opt-in to communication with TRIO support specialists. This could open dialogue that can help faculty build awareness and accessibility into their courses.
