## Rhetorical Précis
%% Review a [description of rhetorical précis from Cuyamaca College](https://www.cuyamaca.edu/student-support/tutoring-center/files/student-resources/rhetorical-precis-description-and-examples.pdf). %%

## Notes
> The thesis to be presented runs like this. One should not treat the acquisition of native language and foreign language as two independent systems, but rather as complementary aspects of one basic cognitive-affective schema, interacting and conflicting with each other in a variety of ways. Moreover, an illumination of the psychological processes impinging on one can shed light, in a reciprocal way, on the other. It will be clear from the foregoing that I shall treat the question at hand as a psychological process, involving the totality of what we somewhat imprecisely refer to at times as personality. [page 3]

L1 and L2 acquisition are two sides of the same process.
This process is related to personality.

> [quoting Guiora 1982] "language and speech incorporate in a unique blend intra and interpersonal parameters, cognitive and affective aspects of information processing, allowing a view of the total person . . ." [page 3]

L1 influences personality and vice-versa.

> [quoting Guiora 1982] "linguistic structures influence personality development and the emergence of stable personality characteristics" [page 3]

> native language is a powerful dimension of self-representation; it is one of the "vital rings" of identity, separating us from others, affirming our uniqueness, *yet* confirming our membership in the "several larger rings of identity: of family, of region, of nation, of culture" (Guiora, 1982).

L1 is central to our identities as individuals and members of our communities.

> confrontation with another language and its structures presents a challenge to native language and its *psychological correlates*, by offering alternative ways not only to describe but also to conceptualize, and perhaps to experience the world in and around us. [page 3--4]

L2 acquisition threatens the stability of personality (as opposed to foreign language? Does learning a language in the context of a foreign language do similar things; I wouldn't think so)

> native language as embedded in the total personality organization will be both a model for, and a barrier to, the acquisition of a foreign language [page 4]

> the vicissitudes of foreign language acquisition, in turn, can illuminate the place native language has in the overall cognitive-affective schema in general, and as this is manifested, in particular, within the unique personality organization of a given individual. [page 4]

> lexis . . . syntax . . . grammar . . . are, from a psychological point of view, trivial. What is not trivial is that some of these differences represent alternative ways of describing, and thus inevitably of conceptualizing and perhaps of experiencing, external phenomena, human relations, and inner states. [page 4]

So a native Spanish speaker learning Italian as a second language may have to learn some new vocabulary and morphemes, but the underlying structure is largely similar. The impact on their personality would be minimal. Now that same Spanish speaker learning Korean as a second language would have a more fundamental shift in the organizing structure of language that their personality would be impacted.

The author gives examples of terms for marriage in other languages, describing them in turn as male-oriented (English and Romance languages *marriage* cognate with mars/male), process or outcome oriented (Hebrew "brought together"), or other-oriented (Hungarian "husbanded woman" and "wived man").

> Obviously, all these languages describe the same phenomenon, but to anchor the observation each uses an associative context that is idiosyncratic, and which resonates to cultural and emotional experiences that are like a closed book to the outsider. [page 5]

> A person, depending on whether it is a man or a woman, will be spoken of, be addressed, and in turn speak, using verb forms and adjective endings dependent on his or her gender. Is it possible that these arbitrary forms will not become associated with intrinsic properties of *being* a man or a woman? I think not. Do not grammatical gender rules create an additional and more differentiated system of identity that is not shared, because it never had a chance to be truly internalized, by speakers of a language that doesn't encompass such distinctions? [page 5]

> Not having the internal schema that obligatorily divides the universe, living and inanimate, according to the male and female principle, these learners don't feel the need to make these distinctions, don't have a "feel" for them, and will wander, if you will, in uncharted linguistic territories. [page 5--6]

> research data bearing on these observations. In a series of studies (Paluszny et al. 1973; Beit-Hallahmi et al. 1974; Dull et al. 1975; Guiora and Sagi, 1978; Guiora et al. 1980; Guiora in press) my collaborators and I have examined the psychological effect gender distinctions in the language have on early development. [page 6] #topic/gender 

> We have compared children in three language groups, graded according to the prevalence of gender rules: Hebrew (maximum gender loading), English (minimum gender loading), and Finnish (zero gender loading). What we have found is that children will reach this important developmental milestone in accordance with the intensity of gender loading in their native language: Israelis before Americans, Americans before Finns. An additional, albeit all-important intracultural difference was found between Swedish-speaking Finns and Finnish-speaking Finns, with the first scoring ahead of the latter, in a fashion similar to the Americans, in keeping with the relative gender loading of the respective languages. [page 6] #topic/gender 

> Perhaps no less significant is the way in which native language imposes an obligatory segmentation of human experience, namely time. [page 6]

> Some languages differentiate only between the now and the not now. Others lump the potential and the predictable together; yet others make a simple distinction between what was, is, and shall be. [page 6]

> we found that English speakers have an advantage, perhaps a permanent advantage, over Hebrew speakers, in placing events in a proper time sequence (Guiora, in press). This advantage seems to be a direct result of the availability of the appropriate linguistic forms of English, to place events in the "before now" in a proper order in relation to each other, and in relation to the "now." The implications of this finding, if confirmed, for a general theory of cognition are considerable. [page 7]

> Piaget (1969) has demonstrated . . . [c]hildren have an apparent difficulty in perceiving the basic interconnection between time duration and succession, that is to say, in discerning precise temporal and causal relations. The development of this faculty is crucial to Western epistemology, and it is not an exaggeration to say that it may have survival value. [page 7]

I would tread with severe caution here, as this is getting awfully close to thinking that if a certain language doesn't have a certain feature, then the people who speak it are inferior. #topic/white-supremacy #topic/bias #topic/bias/asset-focused 

> the process of acquiring a new language is a far more complex cognitive task than it would appear at first. [page 8]

> What is required of the learner is not only a cognitive shift in terms of vocabulary, grammar, and syntax, but something much moire formidable: the necessity to recategorize information, and according to the available *and* obligatory linguistic forms, a task that inevitably must lead to a demand to assimilate alternative and new ways to describe and thus conceptualize, and ultimately experience, events in and around us. [page 8]

> the powerful role native language has in holding together our psychological integrity, in promoting our defenses against any attempts on the impermeability of our language ego (cf. Guiora et al. 1972a). [page 8]

> *individual* differences in the psychological defense systems and flexibilities will be reflected in a capacity (or willingness) to attempt the shifting, to dare the recategorization and the ensuing reconceptualization and re-experiencing, to embrace the "alternative hypothesis" without fear of losing the grip on the psychological integrity for which native language serves as such a powerful anchor. [page 8]

Perceived threats on ones sense of self when learning a language results in resistance to language acquisition.

> We have, over the years, made a considerable effort to tease apart the psychological dimensions of this puzzling state of affairs (Guiora, Brannon, and Dull 1971; Giuora et al. 1968, 1972b, 1980, in press; Taylor et al. 1969; Upshur et al. 1978). The most important finding, I believe, emerging from all these studies is the observation that tenacious as this barrier is, form as the language ego boundaries are, they are not impermeable. Under the right conditions we *are* able to entertain the alternative hypothesis. [page 9]

> The particular cognitive structures so affected may vary from language to language (for example, Hebrew favors the early development of gender identity, while English promotes a better grasp on the perception of time) and while doing so may create rigid, internalized schemata of experiencing, conceptualizing, and describing. These differential schemata may offer, to use a Chinese paradigm, either a challenge or an opportunity, depending on the particular psychological mind set of the individual, and the surrounding culture influencing it. [page 9--10]

> I am suggesting that powerful internal, i.e., psychological, and external, i.e., cultural, forces combine to make language, living language, the persona of our existence. [page 10]

We can develop activities to train the development of these schemata. 
- time order
- possessor gender
- adjective word order
- adverb word order

> if the acquisition of first language is to serve as a model for the acquisition of a foreign language, it will be the psychodynamic and cultural dimensions of that process rather than its formal elements, that will prove to be heuristic. It is only trivial to assert that language, living language, is more than a collection of words and rules of how to use them. [page 10]

> Language, native language is the very lifeblood of human self-awareness, it is the carrier of identity, the safe repository of a vast array of affective and cognitive templates making up the total web of personality. It encompasses what we are, and limits what we are not. [page 10]

> What is needed is a "softening" of the language ego boundaries, to make them more "permeable." [page 10] #topic/mental-health/acculturation #topic/psychology/identity 

> language learning . . . [a] patient and caring process of modeling, trail-identifications, temporary and reversible shifts in self-representation can bring about a venturesome spirit of daring and psychological flexibility that coupled with the capacity to entertain cultural pluralism can open the door to the inner world of another language. [page 10--11]

In other words, one does need a bit of therapy when trying to fully acquire a second language. 

One issue is that most of my students did not choose to take on this work. 

> The difficulties encountered in learning a foreign language should underscore the immense importance native language has for us. [page 11]

> For in truth, native language is the prime vehicle for the transmission of psychological and cultural essence, it is an ever-present embodiment of self-representation, incorporating a view of the world and of ourselves, carrying a national-cultural epistemology. [page 11]

I wonder if this was a foreseen consequence of nationalism. The stronger our cultural boundaries are, the harder it might be to learn a second language.

Maybe this is why people can be very sensitive to changes in languages used around them (i.e., conservative Americans and English-only policies) #topic/monolingual-ideology 

What then would be the cognitive-affective gifts of Sudanese Arabic? Swahili? Shona? Mandarin?
