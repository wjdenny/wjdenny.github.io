## Rhetorical Précis
Ruhma Choudhury and Leigh Garrison-Fletcher, in their chapter titled "Bengali-Speaking Multilingual Writers in Transition into Community College" (2017), argues that linguistic minority students benefit from co-developing academic literacy skills in their first language alongside English. They support this claim with a small, controlled sample of Bengali-speaking college students enrolled in a bilingual academic reading course and comparing pre- and post- academic literacy in both languages and finally comparing success rates of experimental and control groups. Choudhury & Garrison-Fletcher's purpose is to advocate for institutional initiatives that leverage students' linguistic assets rather than demotivate students with a deficit-based approach in order for community colleges to better prepare students for academic, economic, and civic life. They adopt a scholarly tone for the readers of [[@2017ortmeierhooper_linguistically|Linguistically Diverse Immigrant and Resident Writers: Transitions from High School to College]] and others interested in the topic of language acquisition and diversity in education.
## Notes
> Community colleges are a gateway to higher education for almost half of the undergraduate students in the United States (American Association of Community Colleges, 2014). They are particularly important in the education of immigrant students, who are 20% more likely to start postsecondary education at a community college than native-born students ([[@2009conway_persistence|Conway, 2009]]). [page 143]

[[Resident immigrant students tend to choose community college for postsecondary education.]]

> In a recent paper, [[@2011teranishi_immigrants|Teranishi, Suárez-Orozco, and Suárez-Orozco (2011)]] argue that because of the increasing number of immigrants in the United States, the weak economy, and the demand for a more educated workforce, "increasing the educational attainment, economic productivity, and civic engagement (of immigrants and their children) should be a national priority" ([[@2011teranishi_immigrants|Teranishi, Suárez-Orozco, & Suárez-Orozco, 2011, p. 153]]).  [page 143]

> However, a large number of immigrant students entering community colleges are academically underprepared ([[@2011bragg_examining|Bragg, 2011]]). Community colleges need to determine policies and programs to aid transition to and through colleges for diverse student groups who often struggle with completing their degrees. Many students with low English proficiency are placed into basic skills courses, and research has shown that students who require basic skills courses are often unsuccessful in completing college (Bragg, 2011).  [page 143]

> College students placed into ESL programs face especially difficult challenges, as they must rapidly gain the academic English skills needed in U.S. colleges. [page 143]

> In this chapter, we report on a study designed to help one group of our ESL students-- Bengali speakers-- in their transition to college-level academic English by providing home language (Bengali) academic literacy instruction. [page 143--144]

> **==This is not a monolithic group with a homogeneous educational experience.==** Thus, knowing our students' academic backgrounds would enable us to aid them in their transition as multilingual writers at the community college and beyond. [page 144]

> Therefore, in order to aid in these students' transition, we collected background data and provided Bengali instruction alongside ESL. This idea of building on students' home language academic literacy is in line with research on second language (L2) learning that suggests that literacy knowledge in the home language (L1) can facilitate acquisition of L2 literacy ([[@2005cummins_teaching|Cummins, 2005]]). [page 144]

> The research on transfer has shown that for both children and adults, among speakers of diverse languages, academic skills in the L1 transfer to the L2 (Bernhardt & Kamil, 1995; Burt & Peyton, 2003; Collins, 2014; Condelli, Wrigley, Yoon, Cronen, & Seburn, 2003; Cummins, 2009a; Lukes, 2009; Ramani & Joseph, 2010; Shiotsu & Weir, 2007; Thomas & Collier, 2003; Van Gelderen, Schoonen, Stoel, de Glopper, & Hulstijn, 2007; Yamashita, 1999). [page 144]

> Among native Spanish-speaking college students in the United States, Carrell (1991) found that the level of L1 reading was the stronger predictor of L2 reading than L2 proficiency. [page 144]

> In another study focusing on college-age students, Ramani and Joseph (2010) describe a bilingual BA program in English and Sesotho sa Leboa at the University of Limpopo, where "there is no doubt that the L1 is being used as a resource to understand concepts, process English academic texts, understand handouts in English, plan research ..." (p. 53). [page 144]

> To quote [[@2005cummins_teaching|Cummins (2005)]], who is a leading scholar on the transfer of skills from L1 to L2:
> 
> > Although the surface aspects (e.g., pronunciation, fluency) of different languages are clearly separate, there is an underlying cognitive/academic proficiency that is common across languages. This common underlying proficiency makes possible the transfer of cognitive/academic or literacy related proficiency from one language to another. (p. 3)

[[Academic skills transfer when new languages are acquired.]]

> When students are able to bring their home languages to the task of learning, they are better able to link their academic concepts to the second language. However, "this linking cannot be done effectively if students' L1 is banished from the classroom" (Cummins, 2009b, p. 319). [page 145]

> We hypothesized that providing students with stronger literacy skills in their L1 and encouraging students to draw upon their home language would aid the students academically, thus providing a better bridge between ESL courses and credit-bearing courses in the college? [page 145] 

> To measure the Bengali literacy of the students in the Bengali control group and the experimental group, we used the Literacy Evaluation for Newcomer Students (LENS) (Klein & Martohardjono, 2014). The LENS was developed by language acquisition and assessment experts from the Research Institute for the Study of Language in Urban Society (RISLUS) in order to measure the L1 literacy of students entering middle and high school. [page 146]

> Students [taking the LENS], for instance, struggled more with questions on inference, main idea, and supporting details than questions on basic comprehension. [page 147]

> This is in line with the idea that "encouraging students to write in their L1 ... enables them to use higher order and critical thinking skills much sooner" (Cummins, 2009b, p. 319). [page 147]

> Once they analyzed the article, the class wrote a letter to the editor, expressing their outrage and a call to action. [page 147]

> One notable difference between Bengali and English is that Bengali has zero copula (where the copula or connective *be* is often missing) in the present tense [page 148]

> The word order between the two languages also varies. As a head-final language, Bengali generally follows a subject-object-verb word order. [page 148]

> The lab created opportunities for Ruhma to address these differences. Commenting on these discussions, Salma revealed that she found them helpful as they made her more aware of how Bengali influenced her English. [page 148]

> All students described the transition to U.S. schools and colleges as difficult. They all identified English and the differences in the U.S. and Bangladeshi educational system as major impediments. Describing her prior educational experiences, Asia, one of the participants, explained why she found English formidable:
> 
> > For students like me who came from abroad, English language is quite difficult. In Bangladesh, only one subject was in English while the other subjects were in Bengali [Bengali was the medium of instruction while English was taught as a subject]. English is not so prevalent in our country.
> 
> [page 149--150]

> It is important to note that although the educational system in Bangladesh is centralized, the quality of education varies across the country (BANBEIS, 2010). [page 150]

> We see a very notable difference between the experimental group and Bengali control group in terms of pass rates. [page 151]

> Ruhma saw clear improvement in all students from the experimental group. She found that the students were able to use Bengali as a resource in developing English literacy. When the same skills were addressed in both Bengali and English, the students made significant gains in academic reading and writing. [page 152]

> The difference in pass rates between the Bengali contorl group and the experimental group was quite surprising. The pass rate for the experimental group was 75% (6/8) and the pass rate for the control group was 33% (3/9). [page 153]

[[Bilingual instruction for academic literacy skills may improve linguistic minority student success.]]

> When students feel they have valuable knowledge and backgrounds upon which they can build new information, they are less likely to succumb to disruptions based on perceptions of linguistic deficiency. For example, when students view their home language as part of their academic repertoire, even when peers or instructors view them as "less than," the students will be unaffected. On the other hand, students who do not view their home language as a resource will likely lose motivation when tehy are viewed as "less than." This would likely lead to more disruptions in education for these multilingual students in the United States. [page 154]

[[Deficit-based attitudes towards linguistic minority students affects their motivation.]]

> we found that students who worked on their L1 literacy skills alongside ESL outperformed other students, we have started creating and implementing lessons that promote the use of students' languages in the classroom. [page 154]

> It could also be the case that forming a close community with other students, and having extra support from a faculty member who speaks their home language, could explain why the students in the intervention were so successful. [page 154]
