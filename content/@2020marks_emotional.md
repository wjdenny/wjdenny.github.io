## Notes
Emotional intelligence allows us to distinguish between other peoples' emotions and our own.

I wonder if collectivist cultures can differ from individualistic cultures in how strong of emotional boundaries we keep between ourselves and others, particularly family. #topic/culture/psychology #topic/neuroscience 

People who have low emotional intelligence or doesn't have strong emotions may be easily attracted to people with strong emotions. This can be a subconscious process.

Marks suggests a strategy for managing emotions and protecting yourself from other peoples' emotions that sounds a lot like "shielding."
