## Notes
> research on socialization into academic discourse or literacies in one's first of subsequently learned languages or into new discourse communities has received far less attention. Academic discourse socialization is a dynamic, socially situated process that in contemporary contexts is often multimodal, multilingual, and highly intertextual as well. The process is characterized by variable amounts of modeling, feedback, and uptake; different levels of investment and agency on the part of learners; by the negotiation of power participants.

> How do newcomers to an academic culture learn how to participate successfully in the oral and written discourse and related practices of that discourse community?

> How does interaction with their peers, instructors, tutors, and others facilitate the process of gaining expertise, confidence, and a sense of authority over those practices over time?
