## Rhetorical Précis
Dr. Pacheco-Vega, in his blog article titled "Finding the most relevant information in a paper when reading" (2017), argues that identifying three critical pieces of information of a paper can help a reader decide whether or not to engage more deeply with it. He supports this claim by identifying three typical locations in a paper's organization (abstract, introduction, and conclusion) along with their own caveats, and finally suggests that readers focus on identifying the context, the literature gap, and the contribution of the paper. Pacheco-Vega's purpose is to explain how to identify these three critical elements of a paper in order to help students and research assistants more effectively process their reading workloads. He adopts an informal but professional tone for the readers of his blog and others interested in the topic of knowledge management.
## Notes
> I think _we always should read abstracts_, but be somewhat skeptic of whether they will provide us with the full description of what the paper is about.

Abstracts don't always give us a complete and accurate overview of the contents of a paper.

> the introduction to a paper will tell me, by the second or third paragraph, what the paper is about.

> I always zoom in on the introduction because that’s where I expect that the paper authors’ will set up the entire manuscript. I look for a summary of the paper (again, looking at the **context for why this research is needed**, **the gap in the literature**, and what the **contribution of the paper** is).

> One of the suggestions that many scholars and academic writing coaches offer is that one should read at least the following elements if one is in a rush.  
>
>- The abstract.
>- The introduction.
>- The conclusion.

>I tend to agree, which is why I suggested that this is a three elements/steps method, though in methodological papers, I tend to focus more on the actual application of the method. But I **always** expect that the _abstract_, _introduction_ and _conclusion_ will follow a storytelling model and that they will provide me with a broad overview of what the paper is about (this suggestion applies obviously to larger-size manuscripts, like books).

> In the **conclusion** of a paper, I always expect to find a summary of what’s been done and how

> these three elements may provide a tool to decide on whether to do a [detailed memorandum](http://www.raulpacheco.org/2016/07/writing-effective-memorandums/) on the paper, whether to simply write [a rhetorical precis](http://www.raulpacheco.org/2016/10/using-the-rhetorical-precis-for-literature-reviews-and-conceptual-syntheses/), and what kind of information to look for throughout the paper for your [Conceptual Synthesis Excel Worksheet](http://www.raulpacheco.org/2016/06/synthesizing-different-bodies-of-work-in-your-literature-review-the-conceptual-synthesis-excel-dump-technique/).
