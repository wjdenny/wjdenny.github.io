## Notes
> 20% of Canadians identify with a mother tongue other than the official English (58% of population) and French (22% of population) (Statistics Canada, 2013). [page 157]

> this chapter seeks to illustrate the specific circumstances of the linguistic landscape of Canada; the country's official language policies provide a useful site to consider the relationships between pluralist language policy and multilingual writing education. [page 157]
