## Notes
> The CCSS were developed by the National Governors Association Center for Best Practices (NGA) and the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO), in response to a perceived need by members of these associations for a set of consistent learning goals that would be common for all students across states. They claim that schools have gradually lowered standards for grade-level expectations over the last half century (NGA & CCSSO, 2010a). The NGA and CCSSO identified the need to increase the difficulty of what students are expected to know and be able to do at each grade level in order to prepare students to be college and career ready. [page 36]

Look into these two groups-- elected? appointed?

> These standards were developed for a general student population and did not take into consideration the demands they would present for specific populations, including special education students and English language learners (ELLs). These standards are meant to serve as the target for student performance skills at each grade level and have their roots in the standards movement in the Untied States. [page 36]

> explores how the development of habits of mind in the context of a developmental trajectory for writing and a learner pathway could address the shortfalls of the CCSS focus on text types. [page 36]

> The development of standards in the Untied States ... dating back to the late 1800s (Kusch, 2009) ... *Nation at Risk* (1983) report declared "all children can learn" (as cited in Rothman, 2011, p. 15). In his history of the CCSS, Rothman explains that the rise of standards was intended to help fulfill this belief in universal achievement: "By making clear what good performances are, schools can signal to students what they need to do to succeed" (p.16). [page 37]

> Without this coordinated effort, Rothman argues, standards as educational reform are not as effective. The problem of alignment in standards reform was demonstrated later, after the landmark No Child Left Behind legislation institutionalized standards in American education. [page 37]

How have US standards influenced other countries' education?
How did education standards develop in the United States?

> an era defined by the rapid progression of the high-stakes testing movement, started with the passage of No Child Left Behind (NCLB) in 2001. NCLB requires states to test all students in grades 3 through 8 (approximately ages 8--13) and in high school annually using standardized tests. Test scores are used to gauge student performance on content standards in Reading/English Language Arts, Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies. No federal education policy has greatly impacted English language learners more than NCLB since the passage of the Bilingual Education Act in 1968 (Menken, 2008). [page 37]

What is NCLB?

> Discrepancies arose between student performance on state proficiency tests and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), which might have suggested standards varied widely from state to state or that some states' standards were inadequate (Rothman, 2011). But the picture became murkier after Whitehurt (2009) found that even states with high-quality standards were doing poorly on NAEP. Whitehurt argued that standards were a "leaky bucket" (Whitehurt, 2009, p. 7)-- because even if states set high and explicit standards for students, implementation of those standards varied so widely from school district to school district that the effectiveness of the standards on student achievement was greatly diminished on student assessments. The need for a national set of unified standards and a solution to Whitehurt's "leaky bucket" motivated the formation of the CCSS in the late 2000s. [page 37--38]

What was the problem with standardized assessment of NCLB?
Why was the CCSS created?
How did CCSS attempt to solve earlier problems?

> The development of the CCSS was based on three criteria that aimed to address the issues of "leaky bucket" and variation. These criteria included: "academic knowledge and skills all students need to be ready for college and careers," "research on college and career readiness," and "international benchmarking" (NGA & CCSSO, 2010c, p. 66). [page 38]

> "leaky bucket" remained an issue [page 38]

> implementation could dissipate that focus if teachers interpreted differently what the standards meant. [page 38]

> student writing models with annotation as well as exemplar reading texts (NGA & CCSSO, 2010b) help stop the holes in the "leaky bucket." [page 38]

The ELA course sequence is a massively leaky bucket as there are currently no means for standardization on how or if instructors teach or assess student learning outcomes.

> NCLB, student assessment will continue to be tethered to school funding and teacher pay, then the accountability measures will continue to be high stakes, stripping away more and more teacher autonomy and professional judgement, leading to the prevalence of prepackaged curriculum and routine student assessments. .. these measures are designed to keep pace with established educational standards and how students should be performing according to the expectations of the current standards, which do a disservice to students who may need additional support in certain areas. If structured curricula are mandated along with assessments, teachers will not have the freedom to use their professional judgement to focus more time on trouble areas or to take advantage of teachable moments but will have to follow the regimented curriculum despite how well students understand the material (Zacher Pandya, 2011). [page 38]

What specific problems do CCSS cause for ELLs and their teachers?

> "Anchor Standards" that are designed to prepare students to be college and career ready (NGA & CCSSO, 2010b). These standards are designed for a general student population. They do not refer to English language learners (ELLs) nor explain how they expect them to fulfill the standards. The standards specifically say that it is beyond the scope of the CCSS to address the needs of ELLs (and special education students) and offers a short three-page document about the CCSS and ELLs titled "Application of Common Core State Standards for English Language Learners" (NGA & CCSSO, 2010a). This lack of attention to ELLs in the CCSS has led scholars to focus on the needs of ELLs in explicit ways, and several publications have addressed the language and content demands of the CCSS for ELLs by providing specific pedagogical practices for this student population (see Bright, Hansen-Thomas, & de Oliveira, 2015; Civil & Turner, 2014; de Oliveira, in press, de Oliveira, Klassen & Maune, 2015b; Spycher, 2014). [page 39]

> The CCSS for ELA (NGA & CCSSO, 2010b), in particular, present challenges for teachers who have ELLs in their classrooms due to the CCSS demands for engaging in discussions, expressing ideas clearly and fluently, reading and writing complex texts, and using language at an advanced level. An emphasis is placed on writing as the primary means of demonstrating knowledge and communicating knowledge clearly to an audience based on real and imagined experiences (NGA & CCSSO, 2010b). [page 39]

> The fulfillment of the secondary writing standards are contingent on the comprehension and execution of the reading and language standards, which present particular challenges for ELLs, even at advanced levels of language proficiency. [page 39]

> such as linking words [page 40]

aka transitions-- maybe some of Gilliland's observations can be explained by terminology? [[@2017gilliland_opportunity#^fdd7ef]] but doesn't seem like it

> The CCSS also provide a compilation of student samples (NGA & CCSSO, 2010c) that serve examples of how the language is used to fulfill the purpose of the text types, which the teacher could utilize to conduct a language analysis of the text type with students to determine the type of language that is commonly used to fulfill the purposes of the text type. [page 40]

> According to the CCSS, the argumentative text type is the most important of the three text types in terms of college preparedness, as university is characterized as an "argument culture" (Graff, 2003, as cited in NGA & CCSSO, 2010d, p. 24), and that up until now, only 20% of students had been adequately prepared for the argumentative writing they would be expected to do. Therefore, the explicit detailing of how to create a plausible or persuasive argument, establishing trustworthiness and the encouragement of critical thinking, is particularly important according to the CCSS. [page 40--41]

I need a survey each semester to give me a better picture of the education experiences of my students. Maybe not a survey, though, but a conversation. 

> The emphasis on informational writing raises specific linguistic challenges for ELLs. Many ELLs do not have experiences with informational texts in their home lives and, therefore, maybe unfamiliar with the language expectations of informational texts in school. This has the effect of favoring students of certain backgrounds who have access to such writing; on the other hand, it makes it more difficult for ELLs who do not have access to informational texts outside of school to achieve as much success in writing as their more favored classmates. [page 41]

> and that students must "learn to appreciate that a key purpose of writing is to communicate clearly to an external, sometimes unfamiliar audience" (NGA, CCSSO, 2010c, p. 18).

> and be able to use technology to produce writing and to interact and collaborate. More details are given in the general "language standards," which apply to spoken language as well as written and require students to "understand how language functions in different contents, to make effective choices for meaning or style" as well as "demonstrate understanding of figurative language, word relationships and nuances" (NGA & CCSSO, 2010c, p. 51). Under "Conventions of Standard English," students are expected to "demonstrate command of the conventions of standard English grammar and usage . . . capitalization, punctuation and spelling when writing" (NGA & CCSSO, 2010c, p. 51). [page 41--42]

> The *Framework for Success in Postsecondary Writing*, for example, jointly developed by the Council of Writing Program Administrators, the National Council of Teachers of English, and the National Writing Project, describes "*habits of mind* and *experiences with writing, reading, and critical analysis* that serve as foundations for writing in college-level" (2011, p. 2). This framework, then, moves beyond a discussion of what student writers should know and be able to do to also include how students write and think as well as how they may experience writing (Johnson, 2013). [page 42]

> the current conceptualization of the text types into three general categories many years of research on a developmental trajectory of learning to write across the years of schooling and a variety of genres (e.g., Christie & Derewianka, 2008; Derewianka & Jones, 2013; Schleppegrell, 2004). [page 42]

> The text types of the CCSS can be seen as "modes of discourse" that include Narration, Description, Exposition, and Argument. Dating back to 1827 (Newman, 1827), this classification system in composition studies was very influential and became the "norm" for teaching composition in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. As the field of composition became more specialized and focused on writers' purposes, the importance of the modes classification scheme diminished, especially after 1950 (Connors, 1981). With the focus on the main text types as narrative, informational/explanatory, and argument, the CCSS seem to be going back to the nineteenth and twentieth century system of classification, as there clearly is little understanding about a much more useful concept-- genre and genre families. There is, therefore, a modes/genre disconnect between the CCSS and composition teaching in college because there is little conversation and collaboration between secondary and postsecondary instructors. [page 42--43]

> Different stages within a particular genre are identifiable by their linguistic and grammatical patterns to achieve a social purpose in a particular context. [page 43]

> An understanding of genre would be extremely beneficial to teachers to address writing expectation and moves that go beyond an introduction, body, and conclusion. A more nuanced view of writing as having a purpose, audience, specific goals and stages, and patterns that construct these expectations is a critical need for teachers. [page 43]

> This learner pathway includes the major shifts in using language across these phases and demonstrates how narrative genres in earlier years arranged through time move to expositions and arguments arranged through cause in later years (Christie & Derewianka, 2008). This learner pathway is valuable for understanding a progression from the more everyday, commonsense narrative genres to the more academic, uncommon sense of expositions and arguments. [page 44]

> ELLs may enter schools at various grade levels, it is important to provide a foundational knowledge of narrative genres as they move to informational/explanatory and argument genres. [page 44]

> They go on to say that "it is possible to meet the standards . . . without displaying native-like control," which seems to place the responsibility of addressing ELLs' language development solely on the shoulders of teachers. The "Application of Common Core State Standards for English Language Learners" document notes general advice for the CCSS implementation, noting that these students will "require additional time, . . . support and aligned assessments . . . adjusting instruction . . ." and mentions that ELLs have access to various support facilities (NGA & CCSSO, 2010a, p. 3). [page 44]

> This student population is consistently ignored when content standards are conceptualized, but should not be an afterthought. [page 46]

> Although the prescription of teacher pedagogy is not outlined in the CCSS, past research (e.g., Enright & Gilliland, 2011; Zacher Pandya, 2011) has shown that as assessments are created based on standards, the professional practice of teachers will be affected. [page 46]

> Teachers of ELLs may find themselves struggling to meet the needs of this population unless more is done to specifically prepare them to teach writing in ways that would provide more of a learner pathway and consider the developmental trajectory for writing. [page 46]

> Teachers need to be able to adapt their instruction to the ELLs' experiences, being reflexive to the needs of the students rather than following the grade-level standards too strictly. A better understanding of text types as "genre families" may help teachers to focus on specific genres that are more precise in their purposes and language choices. [page 46]
