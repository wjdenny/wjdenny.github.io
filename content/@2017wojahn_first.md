## Notes
> According to the U.S. Census (2014), about 13% of those living in the United States are foreign born, and nearly 21% of the U.S. population speaks a language other than English in teh home. This trend is particularly notable for young people. One in your young adults aged 18--34, or 17.9 million people, speaks a language other than English in the home. That number is up to one in three in states such as New Mexico, Texas, and New York, and as high as one in two in California. [page 173]

> However, the benefits of multilingualism, such as increased cognitive development and greater metalinguistic awareness (García, 2009), are frequently erased due to educational, economic, and linguistic structures that disadvantage many multilingual school-age students. [page 173]

> As a result, students who transition into higher levels of schooling might not perceive their multilingual fluency as a resource to draw upon. [page 174]

This might be useful to try and survey students on these attitudes towards their L1 in the beginning of the semester. Also, look into strategies for surveying non-native English speakers in English. That seems to be a limit in that style of research.

> Our survey-based study seeks to identify aspects that might interrupt or disrupt students' educational trajectory. We compare response about obstacles faced in first-year composition from students whose first language was not English to those of students who had used English all of their lives. We also look at whether responses from language minority students who did *not* pass first-year composition provide different responses than do those who earned a top score in the course. [page 174]

> We also sought to hear more about experiences *outside* of the classroom that might have helped or hindered their progress, such as transportation, access to the Internet from home, a sense of control over their grades (For more on this factor, see Dinther, Dochy, & Segers, 2011), finances, job or volunteer commitments, use of campus resources, and family and personal relationships (For more on this aspect related specifically to Latino students, see Torres & Solberg, 2001). The survey allowed us to home in on distinctions based on linguistic diversity while preventing us from focusing only on student deficits. [page 175]

> By using a high grade ("A") and the three non-passing grade ("DFW") as a framework, we attempt to extract what Yosso (2006) has called "the array of cultural knowledge ,skills, abilities and contacts possessed by socially marginalized groups that often go unrecognized and unacknowledged" (p. 69). [page 175]

> just over half (51%) consider English their best language for speaking. However, the majority listed English as their best language for various purposes: 80% listed English as their best language for reading and 79% as best for writing. [page 176--177]

> Here we see what could be considered an obstacle for a number of students: finding one's best language for reading and writing to be English but one's best language for speaking another. [page 177]

> With an average score close to "Always," students whose first language was English (m = 3.75, sd = .60) reported more access to textbooks than did language minority students (m = 3.37, sd = .88), with an average score close to "often" ($F_{(1,180)} = 8.14; p = .005$). In addition, students who had earned an "A" reported more access (m = 3.73, sd = .62) than did students who did not pass the course (m = 3.40, sd = .88; $F_{(1,180)} = 5.84; p = .02$). [page 177--178]

> When asked the extend to which they can readily access a computer, most students reported nearly always having access to a computer. There was no statistical difference in reported access to technology with respect to students' first language. Those whose first language was English averaged 3.73 (sd = .63), a score close to "Always," while the average for those whose first language was other than English, at 3.56 (sd = .75), a score just between "Often" and "Always," was similar. However, there was a significant difference with respect to reported technology access among those who earned an "A" (m = 3.76, sd = .60) and students who did not pass the course (m = 3.20, sd = .83; $F_{(1,180)} = 3.85; p = .05$). [page 178]

There is more variability in access to technology for education among students who did not pass the class and for multilingual students in general.

> With respect to challenges with reading, we were surprised to find no main effect for grade, that is, no mean differences between students who received an "A" (m = 1.42, sd = .80) as opposed to students who received a "DWF" (m = 1.60, sd = .88) in the course. [page 179]

Wojahn et al. (2017) found that [[Reading ability is not a significant factor in the success of linguistic minority students.]]

> In contrast to their counterparts for whom English was a *first* language, students whose first language was *other than* English reported attending at quite high rates (m = 3.5; sd = .58), a score between "Often" and "Always." This rate was similar to that of the students overall who had earned an "A." In other words, in contrast to their first language counterparts, the *language minority* students who received "DFW" reported attending regularly, but they did not pass the course. [page 180]

> Several times, students reported not understanding an assignment but being reticent to ask for clarification. For instance, one "A" student for whom English was an additional language acknowledge: "Through out the entire semester I think I only missed one assignment and it was because I didn't know what to do and was embarrassed to ask my instructor (big mistake)." In such explanations for not submitting work, students for whom English is an additional language in particular seem to be embarrassed by their lack of understanding of an assignment or strategy.

What can instructors do to help students feel more comfortable coming to us for help?
Maybe it's better if students don't see me as a "professor". see: [[@2017monty_transitional#^ca3281]]

> The Writing Center proved to be the resource students reported accessing most prevalently. Descriptive results revealed that 38% of students for whom English was an additional language reported visiting the Writing Center, compared to 23% of students who first language was English. Students reported accessing other resources, such as visiting instructors during office hours, at quite similar rates. Given that the Writing Center serves as one of the only sites where domestic English language learners can access assistance related specifically to language, it clearly plays a critical role at our institution. [page 181]

> Given that these students are already showing commitment to attend class regularly, we are left with a number of questions. Can we learn more about why some students don't take advantage of resources such as the Writing Center, instructor conferences, textbooks, supplementary online course activities, and campus technology? Can the university do more to consider costs of textbooks, support students with the learning management system, provide more hours for computer labs, and advertise the purpose of office hours-- strategies that would help all students, not just this cohort? [page 182]

> Still, among the 22% indicating a language other than English as their first in the Languages Background survey, a majority listed English as their best language for reading and writing, but only half listed English as best for speaking. This finding supports the notion that rather than language users being "balanced bilinguals," or equally competent in all contexts, most bilinguals have "diverse and unequal experiences with each of the two languages" (García, 2009, p. 45). [page 182]

[[Plurilingualism accepts that everyone uses a variety of language or dialectal resources for different purposes]]
[[Circumstantial bilingualism is the idea that a person may be proficient in English for specific situations, but less capable in others]]

> Institutional data gathering can lead to programmatic changes. For example, additional data at NMSU also supported our provost's recent decision to move two faculty who teach first-year composition for international students into the Department of English, home to "the" writing program. Previously, composition courses for U.S. residents and international students-- and their instructors-- were separated by departments. Because of the additional staff who are sharing their second language writing expertise, all instructors can now enjoy professional development and extended conversations about how to work effectively with linguistically diverse students in their classrooms, in the Writing Center, and beyond. [page 183]

> At the course level, instructor preparation and attitude can improve the experiences of the growing number of U.S. resident students whose first language is other than English (Miller-Cochran, 2010). A crucial aspect of supporting students in a writing course iks perceiving multilingualism as an asset rather than as a deficit. Jordan's (2009) study of multilingual writers in composition highlighted students' lexical competence, awareness of cultural contexts, and sensitivity to group dynamics. [page 184]

> to learn more about students' language backgrounds and transitions entering college, we can ask students to write literacy narratives at the start of the semester (Ortmeier-Hooper, 2008; Sharma, 2015). [page 184]

> We can offer culturally relevent readings, give students opportunities to write in their home languages, and develop assignments in which students can draw on their cultural knowledge and skills (Ferris & Hedgcock, 2013). [page 184]

> We can avoid timed writing (which can disadvantage multilingual students), carefully scaffold projects, and use technology to deliver information in various modes (Goen, Porter, Swanson, & Vandommelen, 2002). As some students in the study suggested, instructors can be more "flexible," "understanding," and "less judgmental." Students also suggested that it would help if the instructor took more time to "let students know how they are doing in the course." At NMSU, for the first time, the provost is now insisting on midterm grades so students are more aware of how they are doing while there is still time to improve. These types of activities benefit all students, not just multilingual students. [page 184--185]

> At UTEP, awareness of linguistic strengths has already impacted the curriculum of the writing program, which has instructors encouraging students to write in Spanish or other home languages in their early drafts and to continue to use that language in later drafts when the rhetorical situation is appropriate (Brunk-Chavez & Fredricksen, 2008).
