> [!summary] Summary
> There are two studies in this chapter. The first study looks at affective differences of 220 German language students across test types and grade performance and the second looks at affective differences of 369 German language students across test types and position in the course sequence. Findings included
> - The form of an exam can have a significant impact on the level of anxiety students experience.
> - High and low performing students have different test type preferences.

## Notes
> using tests lacking face validity or exams causing high anxiety could create a negative attitude toward instruction, and this in turn could adverse affect progress in learning the language. Pimsleur (1970) argues that appropriate testing can help alleviate high dropout rate, underachievement, discipline problems, and negative student attitudes. Taylor (1971) holds that inappropriate testing systems are linked to high failure rate. [page 65]

Anxiety-producing assessments negatively affect retention rates.

> Persons with certain cultural traits may be more susceptible to anxiety on a given language test than others are (Barabasz, 1970; Bronzaft, Murgatroyd, & McNeilly, 1974). Related to this is the possibility that strong negative reactions to a test may seriously weaken performance (though not consistently for all subjects) and thereby reduce the test's validity (Gaudry & Fitzgerald, 1971; Maurer, 1973; Osterhouse, 1975). And some tests may favor one group over another (Labov, 1972; Briere, 1973; Oller & Perkins, 1978; Farhady, 1979; Leach, 1979). [page 65]

Certain cultural traits may be more vulnerable to bias.
Certain types of assessments may bias towards particular cultures.

> And for those with a humanistic bent (cf. Disick & Barbanel, 1974), the study of test affect reflects an interest in the total person and not simply in the intellect or in skill mastery. [page 66]

There is a "humanistic" view of EFL/ESL teaching that views the student as a whole and not just a collection of skills. Seems interesting.

> Over the years it had generally been assumed that anxiety was harmful or debilitating to test performance. But three decades ago, Alpert and Haber (1960) identified facilitating as well as debilitating anxiety. Later, additional theories on test anxiety were advanced, one of the most significant being Spielbegrer's construct of trait and state anxiety. The term "trait anxiety" was used to refer to a fairly stable personality characteristic, while "state anxiety" referred to the more transitory anxiety that tends to "fluctuate in response to different stimuli" (Wildemuth, 1977). [page 66]

> Additional anxiety constructs in the psychological literature have contributed to our general understanding of the anxiety concept. For example, the "worry" versus "emotionality" dichotomy (mental concern as opposed to an automatic physical response) gives additional insight into various types and meanings of anxiety, as does the concept of "interference," which deals with anxiety as a factor that can result in biased or imprecise measurement in psychological testing. For an in-depth review of test anxiety literature, see Hembre (1988). [page 66]

> Some studies have shown, for example, a relationship between gender and test anxiety (Manley & Rosemir, 1972; Tryon et al., 1973; Morris et al., 1976). [page 66]

Gender influences test anxiety.

> The pressure of an OPI administration when it is used for actual grading or placement could increase anxiety significantly (as Stevenson [1979] found) and thus affect performance.

> The effect of various test conditions has also been investigated: unannounced exams (Warner & Kauffman, 1972; Gary, 1973), retesting (Cohen, 1971), use of humor (Smith et al., 1971), music (Stanton, 1973), feedback on test performance (Prestwood & Weiss, 1978), sufficiency of time (Ammann, 1970), as well as the effect of easy-to-difficult sequencing (Towle & Merrill, 1972; Stanton, 1973).

> Initial ESL/FL information on test affect, as we have indicated, was anecdotal and peripheral to the central objective of the research. For example, Savignon (1972), in the course of developing a communicative competence test over a decade ago, noted the "overwhelming" positive reactions of students to that kind of testing. By the mid-1970s a European experiment comparing student performance on native-language versus foreign-language distractors disclosed that "most teachers discovered a (student) preference for offering the questions in the target language" (Groot, 1976, p. 48). Near the end of the decade, Mullen (1979, p. 188) provided a similar narrative summary of attitudes toward the cloze, indicating that examinees regarded it as "an inapprorpriate, even an unfair test." [page 67]

These are sources for the effects of various test conditions on anxiety.

> Of the variables relate to test anxiety, none is more interesting than the impact of exam form. One might assume, for example, that a face-to-face oral interview would normally be more anxiety producing than a paper-and-pencil test (as reported by Zeidner & Bensoussan, 1988). But Scott (1986) found no such effect in her assessment of student reactions to oral language tests; and observations of live oral testing by Jones indicates that oral test are in fact less anxiety producing (Jones, 1985a, 1985b; see also Jones, 1976). Moreover, the nonthreatening nature of many oral interviews is corroborated by a variety of research studies. A controlled experiment by Shohamy (1980, 1982) revealed a strong preference for the oral interview over the cloze. Other studies have produced similar findings. Fore example, an affect study of a six-subtest ESL battery showed that the oral interview was the least anxiety-producing (Madsen, 1982). Murray (1985) found virtually the same results. [page 67]

Oral interviews are less anxiety-producing than paper exams.

> The initial study that follows investigates affective differences at varying ability levels. The second study examine differences in reactions to various test types across successive stages of the learning process. [page 67--68]

There are two studies in this chapter. The first study looks at affective differences among test types with respect to ability level (grade performance) and the second looks at affective differences among test types with respect to the learning level (position in course sequence).

> Since all three multivariate effects are significant (language test, grade group, and their interaction) we are justified in examining the individual ANOVA results for each of these three. All 10 univariate F tests are significant (with an alpha level of $p < .0001$) for the language test factor. That means that the seven language tests differ significantly in the relative ratings they receive on all 10 of the questions listed in Table 1. [page 71]

The form of an exam can have a significant impact on the level of anxiety students experience.

> In these results and those that follow, we see that high-performing students, and also advanced students have a different pattern of affective ratings from beginning students. [page 72]

High and low performing students have different test type preferences.

> Since it is likely that many of the students who receive the lowest grades in German 101 do not continued into 102 and 201, our measure was probably slightly confounded. 
> ...
> Although the information sought is longitudinal, the design is cross-sectional. That is, rather than tracing one group of students through both German 101 and 102 and measuring the same group at different intervals, we have measured different groups at the four stages of progress (four weeks and seven weeks into the semester in German 101 and two weeks and then five weeks into German 102). Although there could be some advantages to measuring the same group over the four time periods, we feel these advantages would be more than offset by the disadvantage of the carry-over effects and expectancy effects from having students repeatedly rating the same tests. Such repeated testing and rating could well alter the reactions that students would ordinarily have toward the tests. [page 79]

While true, I don't understand how this would be valid. The samples are small, what is the likelihood that we could get the results we got by chance? Also, I feel like this would only confound the results even more because poor-performing students may have dropped the class in week 5 or 6. 

> It is recommended that teachers consider the implications of these findings in conjunction with related language test anxiety research. It is now obvious from this study and others (Stevenson, 1979; Mullen, 1979; Shohamy, 1980) that there are major differences in anxiety generated by various forms of tests, and that this anxiety can actually result in a biasing effect against certain types of students (Madsen, 1982). [page 85]

The types of assessment used in the classroom can present a bias towards and against certain groups of students.

> In addition, this study and others (Scott, 1980; Murray 1985) reveal that certain groups of students are more effected than others in experiencing test anxiety. Foreign language and ESL teachers would therefore be well advised to give careful consideration to the types of exams they use in evaluating students language ability. [page 85]

Accommodations, including native language tests, extra time, and consultations can lessen anxiety.

> Adjusting time constraints on language exams can help those who are anxiety prone (Madsen & Murray, 1984). Even the initiative of consulting with students about factors that produce test anxiety has been found to have a pronounced salutary affect (Murray, 1985; Zeidner & Bensoussan, 1988, p. 113).

> And besides this interview procedure there are additional techniques for assesing anxiety, with trait-anxiety measures such as the Alpert-Haber "Achievement Anxiety Test" (Alpert & Haber, 1960) and various state-anxiety measures such as the "Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale" (the FLCAS by [[@1991horwitz_foreign|Horwitz, Horwitz, and Cope, 1986, this volume]]), the simple state-anxiety measure by Jones and Madsen (1980), as well as contemporary IRT (item response theory) "appropriateness measurement" procedures that investigate abberant performance by individuals when taking tests (Weiss, 1983; Hulin, Drasgow, & Parsons, 1983; Madsen, 1987).
