# Using Snipd With Obsidian To Maximize Learning From Podcasts

> [!summary] Summary
> Raymond Sims uses the podcast app [Snipd](https://www.snipd.com/) that allows you to save highlights from podcasts. It includes AI-generated transcripts, summaries, and titles. They even have an [Obsidian-specific export function](https://blog.snipd.com/how-to-export-your-podcast-highlights-to-obsidian-54208c06d491).

His editing process serves as a form of spaced-repetition, and now that I think about it, so does mine. He does the next steps in the note-taking process only when a related line of thought triggers it. That's good advice. He also adds a People note for guests, just like I do for authors.
