## Notes

> Snyder could have found this information through a simple Google search. He turned to ChatGPT because it produced complete paragraphs instead of delivering links that would have left him with more clicking and synthesizing to do. The chatbot’s response helped him quickly write adapted lesson plans for each of his students.

> It excels at formulaic writing tasks because it mimics text that already exists online.

> “ChatGPT solves the blank page problem,” Cody Gough, a marketing professional outside of Chicago, told me. “The worst thing in the world is opening an empty document. ChatGPT helps you start.”

> Alexia Mandeville, a video game designer in Texas, uses ChatGPT to help her brainstorm character names, conceive ideas for trailers and produce news releases for her games. “I’m making something that doesn’t need to be factual,” Mandeville said. Because her work is fictional, she added, ChatGPT needs to be creative, not accurate.

> it can’t facilitate students’ social and emotional learning. But it gives Snyder more time for that work.

> “Everyone is talking about how A.I. is going to replace us,” Snyder said. “I don’t agree with that. It’s going to free up more time at our jobs to do other, more productive things.”

It has the *potential* to free up more time, but I think if we compare working hours and pay centuries ago to now, workers always come out the loser despite any productivity gains due to technology.
