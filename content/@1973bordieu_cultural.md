## Notes
> The science of the reproduction of structures, understood as a system of objective relations which impart their relational properties to individuals whom they pre-exist and survive, has nothing in common with the analytical recording of relations existing within a given population, be it a question of the relations between the academic success of children and the social position of their family or of the relations between the positions filled by children and their parents [page 71]

> the sociology of educational institutions and, in particular, of institutions of higher education, is capable of making a decisive contribution to the science of the structural dynamics of class relations, which is an often neglected aspect of the sociology of power. [page 72]

> these theories are based upon the implicit assumption that the different pedagogic actions [...] carried out by families from the different social classes as well as that which is practised by the school, work together in a harmonious way to transmit a cultural heritage which is considered as being the undivided property of the whole society. [page 72--73]

> the action of the educational system can attain full effectiveness only to the extent that it bears upon individuals who have been previously granted a certain familiarity with the world of art by their family upbringing. Indeed, it would seem that the action of the school, whose effect is unequal (if only from the point of view of duration) among children from different social classes, and whose success varies considerably among those upon whom it has an effect, tends to reinforce and to consecrate by its sanctions the initial inequalities. [page 79]

> By doing away with giving explicitly to everyone what it implicitly demands of everyone, the educational system demands of everyone alike that they have what it does not give. This consists mainly of linguistic and cultural competence and that relationship of familiarity with culture which can only be produced by family upbringing when it transmits the dominant culture. [page 80]

> In short, an institution officially entrusted with the transmission of the instruments of appropriation of the dominant culture which neglects methodically to transmit the instruments indispensable to the success of its undertaking is bound to become the monopoly of those social classes capable of transmitting by their own means, that is to say by that diffuse and implicit continuous educational action which operates within cultured families (often unknown to those responsible for it and to those who are subjected to it), the instruments necessary for the reception of its message, and thereby to confirm their monopoly of the instruments of appropriation of the dominant culture and thus their monopoly of that culture.  [page 80--81]

> he negative predispositions towards the school which result in the self-elimination of most children from the most culturally unfavoured classes and sections of a class---such as self-depreciation, devaluation of the school and its sanctions, or a resigned attitude to failure and exclusion---must be understood as an anticipation, based upon the unconscious estimation of the objective probabilities of success possessed by the whole category, of the sanctions objectively reserved by the school for those classes or sections of a class deprived of cultural capital. [page 83]

He's describing a sort of self-selection of how much education a person seeks out based on their classed upbringing. This is also one way that immigrant community college students are excluded from some programs or "guided" to specific programs; even if they had the classed upbringing to aim for higher degrees.

> the system of dispositions towards the school, understood as a propensity to consent to the investments in time, effort, and money necessary to conserve or increase cultural capital, tends to redouble the symbolic and economic effects of the uneven distribution of cultural capital, all the while concealing it and, at the same time, legitimating it. [page 83]

Wealthy families are able to invest more into the education of their children, thus building cultural capital.

> The functionalist sociologists who announce the brave new world when, at the conclusion of a longitudinal study of academic and social careers, they discover that, as though by a pre-established harmony, individuals have hoped for nothing that they have not obtained and obtained nothing that they have not hoped for, are simply the least forgivable victims of the ideological effect which is produced by the school when it cuts off from their social conditions of production all predispositions regarding the school such as 'expectations', 'aspirations', 'inclinations', or 'desire', and thus tends to cover up the fact that objective conditions---and in the individual case, the laws of the academic market---determine aspirations by determining the extent to which they can be satisfied. [page 83]

I think what he's saying here is that the functionalist sociologists had found that there was balance because lower classes had the jobs and other things they wanted and did not yearn for the trapping of higher classes; and vice versa. But he's pointing out that this misses the fact that people are *conditioned* by their classed upbringing to want specific things.
