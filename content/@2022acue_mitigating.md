> So I use anonymous grading, particularly at the beginning of the course, because I don't really, I know the students a little bit, but I don't know their writing enough to be like, oh, I recognize that's So-and-So. And I do the anonymous grading because it helps me to really focus on the actual writing or the assignment as opposed to the person. Because I, in reality, do sometimes if you have a student, for example, that is very engaged in class and is doing well, you tend to be more lenient on that student. And maybe a student who is absent a lot or seems disengaged, you might try and grade a little harder. And I really do want to prevent that.

> I think anonymous grading can be really helpful. When I first look at the papers of students and I'm going through them, I'm evaluating them, I'm using the rubric. And that way I'm trying to make sure that I'm just assessing based on the work, not my assumptions, ideas, conscious or unconscious, that I have about a student or student's name. However, because I want to make sure I'm serving the individual student, after I've already done the grading of a paper anonymously I'll go back, see who the student is, how it compares to other papers, what else I can offer them to help them be more effective into the future.

> I think anonymous grading is good because a professor cannot be biased to one student, and I think that's really good because a professor should care more about the work of the student instead of the likeness of the student.  

> So anonymous grading is not always possible because sometimes students are doing an assignment and submitting things over and over. And so I get to know the student's writing. Or they might be doing a certain topic and I know that that student or that, those groups of students are doing that particular topic and therefore anonymous grading doesn't quite work. But in that case, what I do like to do is I like to grade all the assignments before I post the grades. And I find that in doing that, I can be more equitable in a couple of different ways. For example, maybe the spelling and grammar, I was really harsh in the beginning and then I'm seeing that people are making the same mistakes over and over again. So then I can go back and reapply the standard and maybe be a little bit more lenient on those others that I was more strict. Or I see a common problem throughout, right? And I figure, you know what, maybe I didn't explain that very clearly. And so I'm not going to take these points off for students because I recognize that it might have been my own teaching or my own explanation that was not clear.

> Dr. Alexander, going back and looking at grades a second time before she submits them really makes me understand that she's trying to be fair to the entire class. 

> **One of the things that I do as an instructor is that I include pretty comprehensive rubrics in with all of my assignments**, and I think this provides the students with an understanding of what exactly is expected of them in that assignment. And it helps reduce the amount of stress that they're feeling about completing these assignments.  

> Rubrics offer an equitable experience for students because they, one, know up front that this is how they're going to be graded, but then they know that's how all students are going to be graded.

> **Rubrics are key.** So understanding what the benchmark is, understanding what the outcome is that you are looking for, for a specific question, particularly in more qualitative and subjective courses, I think that's incredibly important. So recognizing not what is a good answer, what is a four-point answer? What components does a four-point answer contain? And then sticking with that, regardless of whose name or whose student I.D. number is at the top.

> **I share with students through an explainer video how I read the rubric so that they're able to see exactly how I am interpreting the different categories** in order to really create a footing where students understand what's expected of them. Students come into the classroom with a lot of different backgrounds and so sharing all of this information creates a transparency for students that allows them to know exactly what's expected of them and how to engage with the material without, without me assuming that they're going to know exactly how to interpret the rubric or how to even interpret the assignment on its own.

> It's very transparent and you felt you knew exactly what you needed to do in order to get that good grade because it kind of relieves the stress of the grade. So I think it allowed more space to focus on actually learning the material. 

> In using the rubrics, it is helpful to get students not only to look at it, but also to apply it. I like them to, after they've done the rough draft, to take the rubric and apply it to that rough draft to see where it is they need to work on, but also just practice using the rubric. They can kind of see, okay, these are the pieces of the assignment that are going to be graded and this is how it's going to be graded. And then they can also sort of determine how many points, right? Because the rubrics, not every single criteria on the rubric is always worth the same amount of points. So it can also help them really focus in on, "Okay, this is a big chunk. I really need to make sure that this is worth a lot of points, that I really get this correct."

> I use the rubric when completing assignments by looking at it beforehand, circling or highlighting what I need or what I know I need help with, and then after I'm doing the assignment or after I'm done with it, I go over it again. It really helped, I think, with students with disabilities like myself, because we can see what sort of things we need and we can go get help from tutors or straight from the professor.  

> The rubric is not only important in terms of preparing the assignment, but after the assignments, right? So they're given the rubric in terms of the instructions, but as I grade that, I use that rubric and offer feedback related to the rubric. So it allows me to offer feedback to students so they can kind of see where they are and what they need to do to improve in the future. 

> In my teaching and what I teach my graduate students when they're going out into the classrooms is clarity is key. How can we be as clear as possible, have a clear structure of our course, so that people know what they're getting into and so that we know what we expect of our students?
