# Treatment of error in second language student writing

> [!summary] Summary
> #needs/summary 

## Notes
> Corder (1967) argued that what we term as "error" in L2 learners is actually a natural developmental stage. [[Resources/Articles/2011 Ferris.pdf#page=22|page 1--2]]

> Williams (1981) ... asserted that errors are primarily in the eye of the beholder. [[Resources/Articles/2011 Ferris.pdf#page=23|page 2]]

> There is considerable evidence that adult L2 learners may *fossilize* [[Resources/Articles/2011 Ferris.pdf#page=23|page 2]]

> For SLA views on learner noticing and needs for negative evidfence, see e.g., Long (1996); Schmidt (1994) [[Resources/Articles/2011 Ferris.pdf#page=38|page 17]]

> some of these are *global* errors, meaning that they interfere with overall text comprehensibility. [[Resources/Articles/2011 Ferris.pdf#page=23|page 2]]

> For discussions of the "global/local" distinction, see Bates, Lane, and Langue, 1993; Burt & Kiparsky, 1972; Hendrickson, 1980. [[Resources/Articles/2011 Ferris.pdf#page=38|page 17]]

> instructors can get seriously sidetracked in tinkering with students' prose to make it "sound better," when in most instances they should (a) be focusing their feedback attention on more pressing issues and (b) not be appropriating or taking over the students' texts by rewriting them. [[Resources/Articles/2011 Ferris.pdf#page=24|page 3]]

> definition of what we really mean by "error" in student writing:
> 
> Errors are morphological, syntactic, and lexical forms that deviate from rules of the target language, violating the expectations of literate adult native speakers. [[Resources/Articles/2011 Ferris.pdf#page=24|page 3]]

> early discussions of ESL/L2 writing focused primarily on the needs of international students, by the 1990s, scholars began to refer specifically to distinctions between international (visa) and immigrant/resident student writers. [[Resources/Articles/2011 Ferris.pdf#page=24|page 3]]

>For discussions of differences between international and resident student writers, see, e.g., Bosher & Rowekamp, 1998; Ferris, 1999b; Leki, 1992; Matsuda, 2006; Matsuda & Matsuda, 2009; Reid, 1998a, 1998b. [[Resources/Articles/2011 Ferris.pdf#page=39|page 18]]

> Toward the end of the 1990s, the term *Generation 1.5*had become more familiar, especially after the publication of an edited collection entitled *Generation 1.5 Meets College Composition* (Harklau, Losey, & Siegal, 1999). In the ensuing years, we have begun to speak of L2 writers as comprising at least three distinct groups (see Ferris, 2009; see also Roberge, Siegal, & Harklau, 2009):
> 
> 1. International/visa students pursuing an education in an English-dominant country (where English is the relevant L2)
> 2. resident immigrants who arrived in the English-dominant country as adolescents or young adults
> 3. the children of resident immigrants who arrived in the English-dominant country at a very young age or who were born in the new country (i.e., the Generation 1.5 group) [[Resources/Articles/2011 Ferris.pdf#page=25|page 4]]

> *Generation 1.5* is a term taken from Korean to apply to Korean-American immigrants' children (Park, 1999; Roberge, 2002). The term refers to their "in-between status," stemming from the fact that "their experiences, characteristics, and educational needs may lie somewhere between those of *first-generation* adult immigrants and the U.S.-born *second-generation* children of immigrants." (Roberge, 2002, pp. 107--108) [[Resources/Articles/2011 Ferris.pdf#page=39|page 18]]

> What these L2 writers do have in common is that *they all began life in homes in which the primary language was not English (or the L2).* However, what happens in the lives of individual students after these early years makes all the difference to the students' general academic progress, to their L2 literacy development, and, specific to the concerns of this book, the best ways to approach corrective feedback, or treatment of error, to facilitate their overall writing development. [[Resources/Articles/2011 Ferris.pdf#page=25|page 4]]

> Reid (1998a) famously called these [international] students "eye learners," who acquired what they know about the English language primarily through what they saw rather than through what they heard. Many English language teaching materials were designed for these students and assumed background knowledge of terms such as *verb*, *tense*, *subject*, *agreement*, and so on.

> they [resident immigrants] cannot necessarily draw on well-established L2 language and literacy knowledge or on a solid foundation in the L2. ... they may not know formal grammar terms or rules. [[Resources/Articles/2011 Ferris.pdf#page=26|page 5]]

> Reid (1998a) called resident immigrants "ear learners"-- because their knowledge about the L2 comes primarily from what they have heard rather than what they have seen or read. [[Resources/Articles/2011 Ferris.pdf#page=26|page 5]]

> Roberge (2002) discusses several subcategories of Generation 1.5 learners, such as *linguistic enclave* students (those who grew up in a community where nearly everyone spoke exclusively their parents' L1) and *transnational students* (those who regularly traveled back and forth between their parents' home country and new country for seasonal work and had their education interrupted). [[Resources/Articles/2011 Ferris.pdf#page=27|page 6]]

> In a recent study of Generation 1.5 freshmen in a university ESL writing course, nearly all remembered receiving formal English grammar instruction in secondary school, but none described it as being particularly helpful or relevant to them as they completed academic writing tasks in English (Ferris et al., 2010, 2011). [[Resources/Articles/2011 Ferris.pdf#page=27|page 6]]

> instructors cannot apply a one-size-fits-all strategy to the treatment of error in student writing. [[Resources/Articles/2011 Ferris.pdf#page=28|page 7]]

> for effective treatment of error, *it is critically important that instructors take time to get to know their students at the beginning of a writing course*-- their backgrounds, the amount of formal knowledge they have about language, and the particular strengths and weaknesses in writing that they bring into the class. [[Resources/Articles/2011 Ferris.pdf#page=28|page 7]]

> Influenced by theories of behavioral psychology and structural linguistics on second language teaching, teachers gave a great deal of attention to students' accuracy, or lack thereof, constantly correcting all errors so that no bad habits would form. In addition, teachers carefully taught students grammatical forms and rules assumed to be problematic because of contracts with students' native languages. [[Resources/Articles/2011 Ferris.pdf#page=29|page 8]]

> For discussions of contrastive analysis, see, e.g., Eckman (1977) and Wardhaugh (1970). [[Resources/Articles/2011 Ferris.pdf#page=39|page 18]]

> "Meanwhile, back in the real world..." (Eskey, 1983), reminded us that the ability to correct errors is crucial in many settings and that students' accuracy will not magically improve all by itself. Similar concerns were raised by Horowitz (1986), who also pointed out the limtations of the process approach for teaching ESL writers to function in real academic settings. [[Resources/Articles/2011 Ferris.pdf#page=29|page 8--9]].

It does improve with input, though, doesn't it? Isn't that the whole point behind Krashen's distinction between learning and acquisition?
