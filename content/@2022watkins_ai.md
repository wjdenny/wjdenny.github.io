# Guest Post: AI Will Augment, Not Replace

## Notes
> Students, and likely you, will come to use this technology to augment the writing process, not replace it.

^7e9b64

People will most likely use this technology to assist in writing rather than automating it.

> the rate these tools are being deployed and readily adopted means that we’re all likely to use some form of AI assistance in our writing, if we aren’t already. This is why it is crucial for us to teach our students about these models, how to use them ethically and what it will mean for their writing process.

The ability to work with AI effectively is a valuable skill.

> One example is a counterargument generator, which allows students to explore different perspectives on topics they are interested in.

AI writing can be used to generate opposing viewpoints to help students in their arguments.

> used Elicit’s AI research tool to help students brainstorm research topics. Elicit provides a quick summary of articles using a research question as a prompt, making it easier for students to find relevant information from a database of open-access journal articles. It’s like JSTOR on 1980s box-office Schwarzenegger steroids.

LLMs can be used to query large amounts of literature in a short time.

> Students shared that using these apps in scaffolded assignments can enhance their creative process, a promising outcome, when both students and faculty approach the technology with caution. One student reflected on how Elicit helped them expand their knowledge, saying, “Some of the ideas that Elicit gave me I had already thought of, but the ones that I didn’t have were outside my scope of thinking, which is really helping me start to expand on new ideas.” Another student shared that Elicit provided them with a “broader perspective about what details [they] should write about.” Students also found value in using Fermat to explore counterarguments, with one student saying, “The AI was helpful when I figured out how to use it, although there are still parts of it that confuse me. I think it is helpful because it looks at your writing and develops all sorts of statements or questions that can go with or against the point you are trying to prove.”

AI-assisted work can promote more creative thinking. This is also related to using it to get over writers' block or help with symptoms of ADHD and dyslexia.

> What message would we send our students by using AI-powered detectors to curb their suspected use of an AI writing assistant, when future employers will likely want to them to have a range of AI-related skills and competencies?

^e43304

The ability to work with AI effectively is a valuable skill.

> If we don’t educate our students on the potential dangers of AI, we may see harmful consequences in our classrooms and beyond. Meta’s Galactica language model was recently pulled from the internet after a disastrous demo where users generated false, racist and sexist research articles.

^5b2c74

Biases in AI-generated work need to be addressed before mainstream use.

> There are a number of these developers out there, like Fermat and Elicit, who are interested in hearing what educators would like to see in these apps. One example is Explainpaper. It was built by Aman Jha and Jade Asmus and launched for under $400 to help students explore and read complex jargon found in many research studies. They have an active Discord channel and welcome suggestions for how their tool might continue to be developed for education.

^29513c

AI-assisted dialogues can help students bridge academic literacy gaps.

This might be helpful for Intro to Nursing students; prompts like "Explain the Krebs cycle in simple terms for a 6th grader."

> We must also consider the broader implications of AI in education, particularly in regions and communities where access to quality education is limited. In these communities, AI writing assistants have the potential to narrow the gap between underresourced schools and more affluent ones and could have an immense impact on equity.

^81459a

Equity issues have been discussed in other areas of AI technology, and when combined with a fear-based reaction from teachers, this is a good argument for promoting the use of AI as a tool for students to learn how to use.
