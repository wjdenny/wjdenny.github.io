Implicit bias is a preference that is not under our conscious control. This is in contrast to explicit bias or conscious bias. Implicit bias is unconscious, which means that it exists outside of our level of awareness. Implicit bias is cultural programming that we get from our family, society, and other social groups. Implicit biases are not necessarily ideas that we even agree with, and often surface in times of stress.
