This page serves as an index of atomic ideas and related maps of content on the topic of linguistic minority post-secondary students. As described in [[Personal Knowledge Management]], the statements represented as links here represent [[Atomic Notes|an irreducible idea]] which is given its own page in the collection in order to allow it to be clearly and uniquely defined and freely associate with other ideas across the collection. It is ongoing work to prune, divide, combine, and cultivate these ideas.

- [[It is a challenge to categorize linguistic minority students]]
- [[Linguistic minority students face a unique set of challenges.]]
## On linguistic minority students' transition from high school to college
- [[Scholars have argued for the importance of understanding the secondary to post-secondary transition of linguistic minority students]]
- [[Less than a quarter of linguistic minority students transition from high school to a 4-year college]]
- [[Being unable to graduate college has a significant negative impact on students career prospects and job satisfaction]] 
- [[Linguistic minority students' education backgrounds vary widely even if they attended local high schools]] 
- [[Prior educational experiences vary even more widely for linguistic minority students that moved to the United States as adults]]
- [[Inadequate transitions between language arts curricula disrupts linguistic minority students' learning progress.]]
## On segregation
- [[Higher education institutions often use a policy of segregation and assimilation when it comes to language diversity]] 
## On changing demographics
- [[The increasing numbers of immigrants is not limited to major metropolitan areas, but is also increasing in smaller towns and rural areas as well]] 
- [[Population of linguistic minority students in K-12 is also growing fast in Canada]] 
## On policy
- [[Non-linguistic interference to education is not addressed in federal policies]] 
- [[Linguistic minority students seem to be an afterthought in education policy.]] 
- [[Community colleges in the U.S. lack a standard way of evaluating English language proficiency.]]

## On language acquisition
- [[Academic literacy for non-native speakers is estimated to take at least five years to truly master.]] 
- [[Many developmental English language classrooms de-emphasize writing in favor of other language skills.]] 
- Few, if any, English language support course sequences are designed to give students more than a couple of years of support.
## On plagiarism and linguistic minority students
- Linguistic minority and majority students commit plagiarism at approximately the same rates. 
- [[Nearly half of American college students report committing at least minor acts of plagiarism]]
- There are cultural differences that may reduce understanding of plagiarism. 
- [[International students are less acquainted with Western academic culture]]
- [[New university students, not just international students, lack awareness of how plagiarism is defined]]
- [[International students are less confident in their ability to accurately reference source material]]
- [[Proper referencing and citation is a complex language skill that is often not thoughtfully introduced in the classroom]]
- [[There are differences in cultural attitudes towards intellectual property and authorship]] 
- Historically in European cultures, [[Reading was a communal activity and recitation of common ideas was the norm]] and this is still the case in many non-European cultures today. 
- [[Some cultures take the view that quoting an author implies doubt or disrespect]]
## Gaps in the literature (or just my exposure to it so far)
- [[@2017ruecker&ortmeier-hooper_paying#^22b6f0|[[@2017ortmeier-hooper:paying-attention]] reports on the concept of *familismo* among Latino students, but I wonder if similar studies have been done for African students; Sudanese, Congolese, etc. Such a study should be directed at colleges with significant numbers of these students; perhaps data from https://www.higheredimmigrationportal.org/national/national-data/ or https://www.presidentsalliance.org/immigrant-origin-students-in-u-s-higher-education/ might help identify those.
- What are the requirements for teaching college-level EAP across the United States? For example, at Iowa, it seems to only require a bachelor's degree in anything. This can pose challenges for EAP programs in finding faculty who have training in working with linguistic minority students and who have committed to advocating for their support.
- Do linguistic minority students have higher rates of communication apprehension than other students ([[@1991daly_understanding]], [[@1991scovel_effect]], [[@1991horwitz_language]])? In order to address this, I would need an anxiety assessment that can function independent of language ability.
